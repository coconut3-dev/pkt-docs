# Introduction

The migration of PKT to the Base blockchain represents a technology evolution for the PKT community and a vastly improved user experience. Base opens up a world of possibilities with best-in-class hardware and software wallets, decentralized finance (DeFi), marketplaces, real-world assets (RWAs), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Moreover, the move to Base blockchain enhances interoperability with other significant projects within the Optimism and broader Ethereum ecosystems. This compatibility extends PKTâ€™s reach and functionality, integrating it into a larger network of blockchain applications and services. Such connectivity fosters potential collaborations and innovations across different platforms and industries and helps drive utility for PKT token holders.
