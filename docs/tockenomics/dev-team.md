# PKT Documentation
Documentation for the PKT project

## Wallet setup
There are several wallets which you can choose from, the easiest to set up are

* [PKT Electrum](./wallet_setup/install-pkt-electrum.md) which has a Graphical UI and supports Windows, Mac and Linux.
* [PKT Wallet](./wallet_setup/pkt-wallet-setup.md) which has a Graphical UI and supports MacOS and works great with miners.
* [Pkt.world Wallet](./wallet_setup/pkt-world-wallet.md) which has a Graphical UI for Windows, works with miners and includes a built-in miner.

You can also setup [PKT Wallet](./wallet_setup/pkt-wallet-setup.md) which is command line only but has greater
scalability and privacy features.
## Mining
PKT is mined using the PacketCrypt bandwidth hard mining algorithm. You can learn how
to mine on the [Mining](./start_mining/intro.md) page.
## Running a pktd instance
You can setup a pktd instance using the instructions on [pktd](./pktd).
