# Community Liquidity
The introduction of new incentives for the community to provide liquidity and engage in long-term staking within Uniswap's liquidity pools marks a strategic advancement for the PKT project. By incentivizing token holders to stake PKT/ETH into the Uniswap liquidity pool, this not only stabilizes price and fosters growth, but makes the market more resilient to large trades that could cause price volatility. Participants benefit from rewards for their staking, incentivizing longer-term investment and reducing market fluctuations . This approach enhances the overall ecosystemâ€™s stability and sustained growth is paving the way for increased investor confidence and the long-term success of the project.
