# What is PKT Network?
The PKT Network is a decentralized media network. It is built to enable global media distribution with integrated payments, censorship-resistance and no geo-restrictions. The network is powered by the cjdns mesh networking protocol.

The PKT Network represents a transformative approach to media distribution, fundamentally redefining how content is shared and monetized across the globe. As a decentralized media network, PKT leverages the robust cjdns mesh networking protocol to facilitate a secure, censorship-resistant platform that is free from geo-restrictions and censorship. This design ensures that creators and audiences can share and consume media content without interference from centralized authorities or limitations imposed by traditional media distribution channels.

At the heart of PKT Network's innovation is its DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) model. This incentivizes individuals across the world to contribute to the network's infrastructure. This community-driven approach not only decentralizes the control and maintenance of the network but also enhances its resilience and scalability. Contributors are rewarded through PKTâ€™s Stake-to-Earn protocol, where participants lock up their PKT tokens and pair with infrastructure nodes that support network operations. In return, operators are rewarded based on the duration and amount of their stake. This incentivization scheme aligns individual interests with the overall health and growth of the network, promoting long-term commitment and stability.

By integrating direct payment functionalities, PKT Network allows media creators to receive compensation directly from their audience, bypassing traditional payment processors and minimizing transaction fees. This integration of decentralized media distribution with seamless payment solutions empowers creators, enriches the user experience, and paves the way for a new era of media consumption that is truly global, open, and unrestricted.
