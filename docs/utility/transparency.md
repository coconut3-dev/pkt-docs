# Payments Transparency

Leveraging its blockchain technology for media content payments, the PKT Network is built to deliver revolutionary revenue transparency. With every transaction recorded on a decentralized and immutable ledger, and using smart contracts, the PKT Network ensures that all financial activities are transparent and verifiable by all parties involved. This transparency is crucial in the media industry, where revenue flows can often be complex and opaque.

For content creators, PKT Network's use of smart contracts automates the distribution of royalties or earnings based on predefined rules, all without intermediaries. This direct method of payment minimizes discrepancies and delays typical of traditional payment systems, allowing creators to see real-time data on the revenue generated by their content.

Content financiers and distributors also benefit from PKT Network's transparent system. They can track exactly how funds are being utilized and see the direct impact of their investments, which aids in making more informed decisions about funding initiatives. By providing a transparent, fair, and secure financial environment, PKT Network builds trust among creators, consumers, and investors.
