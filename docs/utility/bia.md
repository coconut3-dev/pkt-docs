# BIA

The first streaming platform on the PKT Network is BIA, a hub for TV and films. BIA will enable premium content providers to gain access to global distribution with unprecedented revenue transparency using smart contracts and viewership data. Audiences can get paid to support the network and can use their network rewards to cash-out or pay for content.

# Building Audience
Participants install a basic app and are paid to contribute small amounts of internet bandwidth to power the network. The income earned is paid in a digital currency called PKT, which audiences can then use to pay for content. This attracts global audiences interested in passive income and offsets the overhead costs of operating the platform.

# Premium Curation
BIA uses AI technology and an A-list peer review system to curate premium content on the platform. Creators submit their product to renowned talent (producers, talent, etc) who can become revenue-share Premium Executive Producers. AI also identifies trending, up-voted products. This ensures the premium content on the platform.

# Data Transparency
Creators upload their content to the platform using a digital rights management (DRM) dashboard. This enables creators to program a smart contract to automatically pay royalties. When content is purchased, payouts are distributed in real-time to guilds, investors and net profit participants using blockchain technology, with auditable transparency, but without middlemen.

# Worldwide Accessibility
The PKT Network is accessible globally without geo-fencing. This delivers seamless access to worldwide audiences like never before. Using BIA, audiences make money by powering the network. They can cash-out, or use their income to pay for content. As the first platform that pays its audience, BIA can attract adoption and generate revenue like no platform has done before.

# Revenue Model
Once a product is validated by a Premium Executive Producer, it becomes eligible to buy advertising on the platform. Advertising includes home-screen carousels, pre-roll and post-roll spots using a dynamic market bidding system (similar to AdSense). Unvalidated content can be up-voted by audiences into BIAâ€™s trending/discovery categories and then becomes eligible to buy advertising.
