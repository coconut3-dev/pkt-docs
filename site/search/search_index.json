General \u00b6 What is PKT? \u00b6 PKT allows users to monetize their unused internet bandwidth. By participating in the PKT Network you are helping to build a faster, stronger, and more secure, decentralized network. What is PKT Cash? \u00b6 PKT is a native mined coin based on an open source project. There are multiple companies in the PKT ecosystem but no company \"behind PKT.\" What wallets are available? \u00b6 If you're not mining, the best wallet is PKT Electrum , which was developed as part of a Network Steward funded project and supports Windows, Mac and Linux. However, mining into electrum will break it and if you do it, you will need to export your keys to recover funds. If you use Microsoft Windows, the best wallet to use is PKT.world wallet If you use Mac and want to mine, you can use Zulu Wallet If you are using a server, you can use the CLI wallet which is the base code for the PKT.world wallet and Zulu wallet. There is an ongoing wallet called MatterFi which is based on the powerful OpenTransactions technology. You are invited to help beta-test this wallet in #matterfi on pkt.chat. Where can I buy or sell PKT? \u00b6 Currently there are two ways to buy and sell, you can buy wrapped PKT on pancakeswap and then un-wrap it using the ODAPP (NOTE: in order to use wrapped PKT, you will need Binance Smart Chain BNB to pay gas fees. Also note that ODAPP charges 3.5% when wrapping or unwrapping) If you would like a more human experience of buying or selling, you can come to ye ol' telegram chat where PKT has been traded since the beginning. Remember that telegram is a place where scammers lurk, so always read and follow the guidelines and always use escrow, even after you have traded with somebody multiple times. What is the path towards being publicly listed on exchanges? \u00b6 PKT is a decentralized project like Bitcoin, not a centralized token. Community members are having conversations with different exchanges and you can do it too. There are no more details at this time about the particular listing initiatives. The differentiating factors vs. Bitcoin and other crypto coins? \u00b6 The differences from Bitcoin are: PacketCrypt bandwidth hard proof of work replaces SHA-256 1 minute block time 6 billion coins total Mining yields decrease 10% every 100 days in what is called the decimation 20% of each mined block goes to the Network Steward wallet, which funds R&D of the ecosystem Vision \u00b6 What is value proposition of PKT? \u00b6 The PKT project is focused on building a decentralized bandwidth marketplace to decouple the business and technical aspects of internet service from the physical aspect of maintaining infrastructure. The fundamental value is division of labor and lowering the barrier of entry for internet service competition. What is a Cloud ISP? \u00b6 There is an explanation video about Cloud ISPs on Twitter. The role of a Cloud ISP is to perform the technical and administrative aspects of internet service so that the aspects of infrastructure operation can be done by individuals, small businesses and community groups. What do you see as the greatest challenge to PKTs long-term success? \u00b6 Historically, crypto projects achieve the best results when they are focused on use cases and utility. PKT is focusing on building a decentralized bandwidth marketplace where people can earn PKT with their internet and use PKT to pay for connectivity. The greatest challenge is getting the next billion people connected to the internet. What are the applications and software currently being explored? \u00b6 A free to use VPN service called AnodeVPN will be launched in 2021, and users can pay for their VPN speed with PKT Cash. Internet bandwidth sharing and mesh networking are also currently in the stages of development. Mining \u00b6 How is PKT mined? \u00b6 PKT is mined using the novel PacketCrypt bandwidth-hard mining algorithm which requires bandwidth to mine. It uses a combination of CPU and bandwidth, you get an advantage by working together with other miners which requires bandwidth. How will the growth in mining impact the coin? \u00b6 As more people mine PacketCrypt, they will need to invest in more network infrastructure which will become useful later on for making the internet faster and more accessible. What wallet do I use for mining? \u00b6 For mining it's recommended to use the command line PKTWallet due to the amount of mining transactions and it's ability to scale. If you use a Mac then you can also use the PKT-Cash-Wallet for MacOS. Is there an easy way to start mining? \u00b6 There are mining instructions for mining on the PKT website. PktPal is a business in the community which offers turn-key mining solutions. Do miners mining on a single pool have any benefit over miners mining on multi pool? \u00b6 Multi-pool mining means submitting the exact same announcements to multiple pools. So if you have the bandwidth available it will always benefit you to mine in all of the major pools. Network Steward \u00b6 What is the Network Steward? \u00b6 The Network Steward is part of the consensus rules of the PKT blockchain. 20% of every newly mined block goes to a wallet address and then those coins are 100% paid out in grants to help build open-source technology and develop the PKT Network. Network Steward funds must be deployed within 90 days or else they are burned. This address was initially set to a multi-signature group, but it can be changed by a PoS based vote process. Who is the Network Steward currently? \u00b6 A group of 5 volunteers including the original author of the code. More information can be found [here]: (https://pkt.cash/network-steward) How is the (current) Network Steward using the funds? \u00b6 The Network Steward follows a project evaluation process. No funds have ever been deployed except to fund projects which were proposed by members of the public in an open competitive process. The Network Steward operates with full transparency. Every transaction made by the Network Steward can be seen in the block explorer and is refered to in the Network Steward's github repository explaining the project which that transaction helped to fund. Has the Network Steward burned any funds? \u00b6 You can check out the stats on burned coins in the block explorer Network Steward page . How do I submit a proposal? \u00b6 There are currently two ways to propose a project to the PKT Network Steward, if your project is large and has the benefit of accountants to be able to verify that the money has been spent appropriately, you can make a proposal directly to the NS through the NS github Network Steward's Github . The NS opens calls from time to time with a specified budget and during these calls anyone can apply. If you want to propose a smaller project and have the accounting and official reporting managed for you, you can propose to the User Operated Internet fund which is funded by the Network Steward but is administored by NLnet, a well respected public benefit organization which is experienced at managing these types of projects. Dilligence \u00b6 Who is the creator? Is he actively involved? What's his ownership? \u00b6 PKT was created by Caleb James DeLisle, the creator of cjdns. Cjdns is the only decentralized mesh networking protocol which is designed to function in even if some of the nodes in the network are adversarial. Caleb has been mining PKT similarly to everybody else in the project. Who stands to benefit the most from growth and adaption? \u00b6 The early miners and adopters of PKT will benefit greatly. PKT also benefits everybody because it will lead to a lower cost and highly competitive internet service ecosystem. Are there any regulatory or compliance liabilities? \u00b6 PKT is a fully decentralized fork of Bitcoin, so it is similarly considered to be a commodity. What legal disclosures need to made with investments into this? Or are there none? \u00b6 Because PKT is a fully decentralized clone of the Bitcoin codebase, the legal and regulatory framing is probably similar. Communication \u00b6 Has any branding or marketing already been completed? \u00b6 PKT is a decentralized project so there is no official brand for PKT, however the website pkt.cash, logos, and other materials were developed as part of a Network Steward funded project and are usable under the Creative Commons license. Are any brand ambassadors already engaged? \u00b6 PKT is not a centralized project so anybody can be an ambassador. There are a number of companies and initiatives which currently exist in the PKT ecosystem including AnodeVPN and Pkt Pal. Commercial \u00b6 How can I contact the PKT Team \u00b6 You are the PKT team, PKT is a fully decentralized project like Bitcoin, so everyone is the team. The bad news is there is no central authority who can write you a check, but the good news is there are a few businesses in the PKT ecosystem who might be prepared to buy your services. See PKT Commercial for a (non-exhaustive) list. Can I build X with PKT? \u00b6 YES , the PKT community encourages all types of (legal, responsible) business activity in the PKT ecosystem. The ODAPP bridge was created by a community member and was not in the original PKT vision but this bridge is now an important part of the infrastructure of the PKT ecosystem. You can also build your commercial venture and the we in the PKT community will do what we can to help you be successful.","title":"PKT FAQ"},{"location":"PKT_FAQ/#pkt-faq","text":"This is a community defined FAQ, edit this page to improve it.","title":"PKT FAQ"},{"location":"PKT_FAQ/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"PKT_FAQ/#what-is-pkt","text":"PKT allows users to monetize their unused internet bandwidth.

It is recognized that to accomplish the goals, it is imperative that there is a community who understands and uses the technology, so communication cannot be avoided. However, poor communication, even made with the best intentions, risks harming the reputation of the project and the general public. So these guidelines exist to help community members represent the project in the best way possible. A Far Higher Standard \u00b6 Within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, there are a significant number of outright criminal activities. Beyond those there is a wide grey area of communication activities which have not been subject to any regulatory enforcement, but still fall far outside of what these guidelines establish as ethical. Community members are cautioned that due to the scale of these \"grey\" activities, there is a large body of publications, influencers, marketers, \"shills\" and other professionals who, if consulted or emulated, are highly likely to put a person in ethical peril, because these guidelines establish a far higher standard of communication ethics than that which is generally considered to be legal. Principle of No Expected Return \u00b6 It is acknowledged that buying, selling and mining are central aspects of cryptocurrency use, so it is difficult to effectively communicate about the project without ever addressing reasons why a person might do these things. Therefore these guidelines offer a pre-approved narrative which is considered to be maximally protective of the reputation of the project while also providing a healthy perspective regarding the risks associated with cryptocurrency. The Principle of No Expected Return is that one should buy or mine a cryptocurrency if and only if they believe strongly enough in the vision of the project that they would be proud to own the coin even if they were never able to sell it. In the early days of Bitcoin, it was widely believed that it would be legislated out of existence or otherwise collapse, and so this principle was pervasive throughout the community. Many people chose to hold Bitcoin as a political statement regarding the morality of modern financial institutions, especially after the 2008 financial crisis. The key components of the Principle of No Expected Return are: * A clear understanding of what the technology is and what it is not. * A belief in the social change which that technology can realistically facilitate. * The mental and financial preparedness to lose any money or effort that is used to acquire the coin, as one has when one makes a donation. When you\u2019re considering buying a coin, you need to ask yourself: If you were to lose everything you put into a coin, would you look back on the day you bought it, proud to have been a part of the project at that time? If the answer is no, then you\u2019re either planning to buy too much, or you\u2019re just not ready. Guidelines \u00b6 Dishonest, intentionally misleading, or otherwise unlawful communication is obviously unethical, but beyond that there is no clear definition for unethical communication, though one could characterise it in the words of Justice Stewart, \"I know it when I see it\". These non-exhaustive guidelines exist to give community members an understanding of the types of communication which are most likely to be unethical. They are listed in order of importance with the most important first. Communications which follow the letter, but not the spirit, of these guidelines are unethical. One example of this is token disclaimers such as \"this is not financial advice\". Disclaimers can be useful for helping a person understand the limitations and caveats of a communication, but a token disclaimer exists more to make the communicator seem innocent than to help the audience have a clearer understanding. The use of fine print, or disclaimers which \"feel out of place\" in the overall communication should be regarded as red flags, and communicators using these should review the objectives of their message and whether it is being communicated clearly. Communications which a person of sound judgement could plausibly interpret as presenting a low risk low effort opportunity to make money , or \u201csomething for nothing\u201d, are unethical. Presenting an opportunity can take many forms including implication though specific selection of facts, or an over-celebratory tone. Generally speaking, communications should be explicit about their objective so that there is minimal chance of mis-interpretation. Communications which a person suffering impaired judgement has an unusually high likelihood of interpreting as a low risk low effort opportunity to make money are unethical. Topics like \u201cwinning\u201d, \u201cpump\u201d, \u201cFOMO\u201d, \u201cYOLO\u201d (spend all of your money), \u201cmoon\u201d, and the idea of being rich, may strike the average person as nothing more than a bit of low-culture humour, but for a pathological gambler these can trigger a harmful thought process and should be avoided. Communications related to investment and trading of the coin should be addressed to investors and traders \u2014 professionals who know how hard it is to reliably beat the market and who make decisions based on their own unique portfolio and risk management strategy. Any kind of communication around these topics which has a celebratory tone, or which could reasonably be interpreted as investment advice is not ethical. Communications which focus entirely on explaining a piece of technology, without any mention or implication of buying, selling, price, or potential future growth (including growth in usage of the technology), are probably ethical. Communications which address the topic of buying, selling or mining, but are specifically focused on the Principle of No Expected Return, are probably ethical. Examples to Avoid \u00b6 These passages are examples of the type of communication which is likely to be problematic. Context is key, and in the context of a communication which clearly transmits an ethical core message, a passing mention of money probably does not make the whole communication unethical. But if the core message is not communicated with adequate clarity, then even the slightest mention of topics like the following may make the communication unethical. \"price has grown by 50% over the past 3 months\" \"George has made $700 mining with his old computer\" \"reaping the rewards for something you put zero effort in!\"\" \"build a fund for rainy days\" \"earning passive income at any time of day, even when sleeping\" \"early adopters have the most to gain\" \"miners who accumulate the coin are rewarded whenever there is significant price appreciation\" \"so many people trust cryptocurrency investment\" \"gain financially by facilitating connectivity\" While some of these statements may be factual, they share a common narrative that there is an opportunity, it is easy, and it leads to making money. This is a stark contrast from the Principle of No Expected Return. Better Examples \u00b6 Honest communications addressing topics like the following are more likely to be ethical. \"price has been on the rise, but this can be affected by current events outside the project, so core community members are more focused on continuous progress toward the goal\" \"'I pay for my internet, so I might as well use it\"', said George who has been mining with his old computer\" \"we all know internet is over-priced, but now there is a community of people trying to do something about it\" \"'I know cryptocurrencies are risky, and tomorrow it could all be worth nothing, but I'm spending money I can afford on a something I believe in' said Tom, who recently bought coins\" \"the control that big telecoms have over our everyday lives can make people feel powerless, but now there\u2019s an easy way to push back\" \"sometimes the price goes up and sometimes it goes down. Being part of the community is about believing that democratised internet is possible\"","title":"Ethical Communication Guidelines"},{"location":"communication/#ethical-communication-guidelines","text":"This is a guideline for ethical communications about the project. It is recognized that to accomplish the goals, it is imperative that there is a community who understands and uses the technology, so communication cannot be avoided. However, poor communication, even made with the best intentions, risks harming the reputation of the project and the general public. So these guidelines exist to help community members represent the project in the best way possible.","title":"Ethical Communication Guidelines"},{"location":"communication/#a-far-higher-standard","text":"Within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, there are a significant number of outright criminal activities. Beyond those there is a wide grey area of communication activities which have not been subject to any regulatory enforcement, but still fall far outside of what these guidelines establish as ethical. Community members are cautioned that due to the scale of these \"grey\" activities, there is a large body of publications, influencers, marketers, \"shills\" and other professionals who, if consulted or emulated, are highly likely to put a person in ethical peril, because these guidelines establish a far higher standard of communication ethics than that which is generally considered to be legal.","title":"A Far Higher Standard"},{"location":"communication/#principle-of-no-expected-return","text":"It is acknowledged that buying, selling and mining are central aspects of cryptocurrency use, so it is difficult to effectively communicate about the project without ever addressing reasons why a person might do these things. Therefore these guidelines offer a pre-approved narrative which is considered to be maximally protective of the reputation of the project while also providing a healthy perspective regarding the risks associated with cryptocurrency. The Principle of No Expected Return is that one should buy or mine a cryptocurrency if and only if they believe strongly enough in the vision of the project that they would be proud to own the coin even if they were never able to sell it. In the early days of Bitcoin, it was widely believed that it would be legislated out of existence or otherwise collapse, and so this principle was pervasive throughout the community. Many people chose to hold Bitcoin as a political statement regarding the morality of modern financial institutions, especially after the 2008 financial crisis. The key components of the Principle of No Expected Return are: * A clear understanding of what the technology is and what it is not. * A belief in the social change which that technology can realistically facilitate. * The mental and financial preparedness to lose any money or effort that is used to acquire the coin, as one has when one makes a donation. When you\u2019re considering buying a coin, you need to ask yourself: If you were to lose everything you put into a coin, would you look back on the day you bought it, proud to have been a part of the project at that time? If the answer is no, then you\u2019re either planning to buy too much, or you\u2019re just not ready.","title":"Principle of No Expected Return"},{"location":"communication/#guidelines","text":"Dishonest, intentionally misleading, or otherwise unlawful communication is obviously unethical, but beyond that there is no clear definition for unethical communication, though one could characterise it in the words of Justice Stewart, \"I know it when I see it\". These non-exhaustive guidelines exist to give community members an understanding of the types of communication which are most likely to be unethical. They are listed in order of importance with the most important first. Communications which follow the letter, but not the spirit, of these guidelines are unethical. One example of this is token disclaimers such as \"this is not financial advice\". Disclaimers can be useful for helping a person understand the limitations and caveats of a communication, but a token disclaimer exists more to make the communicator seem innocent than to help the audience have a clearer understanding. The use of fine print, or disclaimers which \"feel out of place\" in the overall communication should be regarded as red flags, and communicators using these should review the objectives of their message and whether it is being communicated clearly. Communications which a person of sound judgement could plausibly interpret as presenting a low risk low effort opportunity to make money , or \u201csomething for nothing\u201d, are unethical. Presenting an opportunity can take many forms including implication though specific selection of facts, or an over-celebratory tone. Generally speaking, communications should be explicit about their objective so that there is minimal chance of mis-interpretation.

With Bitcoin there are 100,000,000 atomic units (\"satoshis\") per bitcoin. With PKT there are 2 to the 30th power ( 1,073,741,824 ) atomic units. While this is strange number in base-10, in binary it is a perfectly even 1 followed by thirty zeros. The binary nature of PKT has a few caveats, for example it means sending 0.01 PKT is actually impossible. This is because 0.01 would corrispond to 10,737,418.24 atomic units. Since they are atomic (indivisible), this must be rounded to the nearest whole number: 10,737,418 . When this divided by 2 30 , it results in 0.009999999776482582 . Therefore, all GUI wallets and explorers adopt the following convension: PKT amounts are always expressed with two decimal places and rounded to nearest, so 1,084,479,242 atomic units is displayed as 1.01 PKT . If the amount is less than 1 PKT , the amount is displayed as milli-pkt or mPKT and multiplied by 1,000 , so 10,737,418 atomic units is displayed as 10.00 mPKT If the amount is less than 1 mPKT , the amount is displayed as micro-pkt or \u03bcPKT and multiplied by 1,000,000 , so 107,374 atomic units is displayed as 100.00 \u03bcPKT . If the amount is less than 1 \u03bcPKT , the amount is displayed as nano-pkt or nPKT and multiplied by 1,000,000,000 , so 107 atomic units is displayed as 99.64 nPKT . A single atomic unit is displayed as 0.93 nPKT . While these are the convensions adopted by all GUI wallets and explorers. Exchanges and merchants may choose to forbid transaction of amounts less than 1 PKT , thus they need only implement #1 because they will never display an amount of less than 1 PKT . Fees \u00b6 PKT uses bitcoin-like computation for determining fees. Because the blockchain has a 1 minute block time, there is generally plenty of space for transactions in the blocks and the typical fee is the minimum: 1 atomic unit per byte of transaction size. The size of a transaction depends on the number of transaction inputs and outputs. The number of outputs is simply the number of addresses you are paying, plus one more to re-route change back to yourself. The number of inputs depends on where the coins you are sending have been sourced from. If you are mining PKT, then you may have many tiny transactions which you need to aggregate in order to make a payment. Currently, wallets do not create transactions with more than 1,460 inputs. This results in a transaction of just under 100,000 bytes and thus costing right around 100,000 atomic units or 93.13 \u03bcPKT , that is micro-pkt or millionths of a PKT (for the largest possible transaction). A more typical transaction size would be around 1,000 bytes and thus cost 1,000 atomic units, or 931.32 nPKT (billionths of 1 PKT). In almost every case, the fees will disappear when the transaction is rounded to display the 2 decimal places. It is possible, though vanishingly unlikely that your wallet could display 10.00 PKT and after sending exactly 5 PKT your wallet displays 4.99 . This would happen if the actual amount you had was 9.555555556 PKT , rounded to 10.00 and after sending exactly 5 PKT , the miniscule fee caused it to cross a rounding boundary and become 4.555555553 . If you wish to perform analytical accounting, it is recommended that you deal exclusively in atomic units, represented as an int64, and only represent PKT for display purposes.","title":"PKT Units and Fees"},{"location":"units/#pkt-units-and-fees","text":"As with all blockchains, every transaction of PKT is exact, however unlike other blockchains, the number of atomic units in the PKT coin is not a power of 10.

It is recognized that to accomplish the goals, it is imperative that there is a community who understands and uses the technology, so communication cannot be avoided. However, poor communication, even made with the best intentions, risks harming the reputation of the project and the general public. So these guidelines exist to help community members represent the project in the best way possible. A Far Higher Standard \u00b6 Within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, there are a significant number of outright criminal activities. Beyond those there is a wide grey area of communication activities which have not been subject to any regulatory enforcement, but still fall far outside of what these guidelines establish as ethical. Community members are cautioned that due to the scale of these \"grey\" activities, there is a large body of publications, influencers, marketers, \"shills\" and other professionals who, if consulted or emulated, are highly likely to put a person in ethical peril, because these guidelines establish a far higher standard of communication ethics than that which is generally considered to be legal. Principle of No Expected Return \u00b6 It is acknowledged that buying, selling and mining are central aspects of cryptocurrency use, so it is difficult to effectively communicate about the project without ever addressing reasons why a person might do these things. Therefore these guidelines offer a pre-approved narrative which is considered to be maximally protective of the reputation of the project while also providing a healthy perspective regarding the risks associated with cryptocurrency. The Principle of No Expected Return is that one should buy or mine a cryptocurrency if and only if they believe strongly enough in the vision of the project that they would be proud to own the coin even if they were never able to sell it. In the early days of Bitcoin, it was widely believed that it would be legislated out of existence or otherwise collapse, and so this principle was pervasive throughout the community. Many people chose to hold Bitcoin as a political statement regarding the morality of modern financial institutions, especially after the 2008 financial crisis. The key components of the Principle of No Expected Return are: * A clear understanding of what the technology is and what it is not. * A belief in the social change which that technology can realistically facilitate. * The mental and financial preparedness to lose any money or effort that is used to acquire the coin, as one has when one makes a donation. When you\u2019re considering buying a coin, you need to ask yourself: If you were to lose everything you put into a coin, would you look back on the day you bought it, proud to have been a part of the project at that time? If the answer is no, then you\u2019re either planning to buy too much, or you\u2019re just not ready. Guidelines \u00b6 Dishonest, intentionally misleading, or otherwise unlawful communication is obviously unethical, but beyond that there is no clear definition for unethical communication, though one could characterise it in the words of Justice Stewart, \"I know it when I see it\". These non-exhaustive guidelines exist to give community members an understanding of the types of communication which are most likely to be unethical. They are listed in order of importance with the most important first. Communications which follow the letter, but not the spirit, of these guidelines are unethical. One example of this is token disclaimers such as \"this is not financial advice\". Disclaimers can be useful for helping a person understand the limitations and caveats of a communication, but a token disclaimer exists more to make the communicator seem innocent than to help the audience have a clearer understanding. The use of fine print, or disclaimers which \"feel out of place\" in the overall communication should be regarded as red flags, and communicators using these should review the objectives of their message and whether it is being communicated clearly. Communications which a person of sound judgement could plausibly interpret as presenting a low risk low effort opportunity to make money , or \u201csomething for nothing\u201d, are unethical. Presenting an opportunity can take many forms including implication though specific selection of facts, or an over-celebratory tone. Generally speaking, communications should be explicit about their objective so that there is minimal chance of mis-interpretation. Communications which a person suffering impaired judgement has an unusually high likelihood of interpreting as a low risk low effort opportunity to make money are unethical. Topics like \u201cwinning\u201d, \u201cpump\u201d, \u201cFOMO\u201d, \u201cYOLO\u201d (spend all of your money), \u201cmoon\u201d, and the idea of being rich, may strike the average person as nothing more than a bit of low-culture humour, but for a pathological gambler these can trigger a harmful thought process and should be avoided. Communications related to investment and trading of the coin should be addressed to investors and traders \u2014 professionals who know how hard it is to reliably beat the market and who make decisions based on their own unique portfolio and risk management strategy. Any kind of communication around these topics which has a celebratory tone, or which could reasonably be interpreted as investment advice is not ethical. Communications which focus entirely on explaining a piece of technology, without any mention or implication of buying, selling, price, or potential future growth (including growth in usage of the technology), are probably ethical. Communications which address the topic of buying, selling or mining, but are specifically focused on the Principle of No Expected Return, are probably ethical. Examples to Avoid \u00b6 These passages are examples of the type of communication which is likely to be problematic. Context is key, and in the context of a communication which clearly transmits an ethical core message, a passing mention of money probably does not make the whole communication unethical. But if the core message is not communicated with adequate clarity, then even the slightest mention of topics like the following may make the communication unethical. \"price has grown by 50% over the past 3 months\" \"George has made $700 mining with his old computer\" \"reaping the rewards for something you put zero effort in!\"\" \"build a fund for rainy days\" \"earning passive income at any time of day, even when sleeping\" \"early adopters have the most to gain\" \"miners who accumulate the coin are rewarded whenever there is significant price appreciation\" \"so many people trust cryptocurrency investment\" \"gain financially by facilitating connectivity\" While some of these statements may be factual, they share a common narrative that there is an opportunity, it is easy, and it leads to making money. This is a stark contrast from the Principle of No Expected Return. Better Examples \u00b6 Honest communications addressing topics like the following are more likely to be ethical. \"price has been on the rise, but this can be affected by current events outside the project, so core community members are more focused on continuous progress toward the goal\" \"'I pay for my internet, so I might as well use it\"', said George who has been mining with his old computer\" \"we all know internet is over-priced, but now there is a community of people trying to do something about it\" \"'I know cryptocurrencies are risky, and tomorrow it could all be worth nothing, but I'm spending money I can afford on a something I believe in' said Tom, who recently bought coins\" \"the control that big telecoms have over our everyday lives can make people feel powerless, but now there\u2019s an easy way to push back\" \"sometimes the price goes up and sometimes it goes down. Being part of the community is about believing that democratised internet is possible\"","title":"Ethical Communication Guidelines"},{"location":"community/ethica-communication-guidelines/#ethical-communication-guidelines","text":"This is a guideline for ethical communications about the project.

These non-exhaustive guidelines exist to give community members an understanding of the types of communication which are most likely to be unethical. They are listed in order of importance with the most important first. Communications which follow the letter, but not the spirit, of these guidelines are unethical. One example of this is token disclaimers such as \"this is not financial advice\". Disclaimers can be useful for helping a person understand the limitations and caveats of a communication, but a token disclaimer exists more to make the communicator seem innocent than to help the audience have a clearer understanding. The use of fine print, or disclaimers which \"feel out of place\" in the overall communication should be regarded as red flags, and communicators using these should review the objectives of their message and whether it is being communicated clearly. Communications which a person of sound judgement could plausibly interpret as presenting a low risk low effort opportunity to make money , or \u201csomething for nothing\u201d, are unethical. Presenting an opportunity can take many forms including implication though specific selection of facts, or an over-celebratory tone. Generally speaking, communications should be explicit about their objective so that there is minimal chance of mis-interpretation. Communications which a person suffering impaired judgement has an unusually high likelihood of interpreting as a low risk low effort opportunity to make money are unethical. Topics like \u201cwinning\u201d, \u201cpump\u201d, \u201cFOMO\u201d, \u201cYOLO\u201d (spend all of your money), \u201cmoon\u201d, and the idea of being rich, may strike the average person as nothing more than a bit of low-culture humour, but for a pathological gambler these can trigger a harmful thought process and should be avoided. Communications related to investment and trading of the coin should be addressed to investors and traders \u2014 professionals who know how hard it is to reliably beat the market and who make decisions based on their own unique portfolio and risk management strategy. Any kind of communication around these topics which has a celebratory tone, or which could reasonably be interpreted as investment advice is not ethical. Communications which focus entirely on explaining a piece of technology, without any mention or implication of buying, selling, price, or potential future growth (including growth in usage of the technology), are probably ethical. Communications which address the topic of buying, selling or mining, but are specifically focused on the Principle of No Expected Return, are probably ethical.","title":"Guidelines"},{"location":"community/ethica-communication-guidelines/#examples-to-avoid","text":"These passages are examples of the type of communication which is likely to be problematic. Context is key, and in the context of a communication which clearly transmits an ethical core message, a passing mention of money probably does not make the whole communication unethical. But if the core message is not communicated with adequate clarity, then even the slightest mention of topics like the following may make the communication unethical. \"price has grown by 50% over the past 3 months\" \"George has made $700 mining with his old computer\" \"reaping the rewards for something you put zero effort in!\"\" \"build a fund for rainy days\" \"earning passive income at any time of day, even when sleeping\" \"early adopters have the most to gain\" \"miners who accumulate the coin are rewarded whenever there is significant price appreciation\" \"so many people trust cryptocurrency investment\" \"gain financially by facilitating connectivity\" While some of these statements may be factual, they share a common narrative that there is an opportunity, it is easy, and it leads to making money.

Linux \u00b6 Download the file ending with .AppImage from the latest PKT Electrum Releases Click on the downloaded file and PKT Electrum should start up right away. Setting up your wallet \u00b6 Before you can begin using PKT, you need to setup your wallet, this means writing down your secret key and setting passwords so your PKT will stay safe. First you will be asked if you want to configure the server to connect to, unless you are an advanced user, just click \"next\" Next select your wallet, you give your wallet a name if you wish, or leave it as default_wallet , then click \"next\". You will be prompted to select which type of wallet you are creating, unless you are doing something fancy, you'll want to just click \"next\" Next you will have the option to create a wallet using a secret key from different sources, for the purposes of this tutorial just click next. Next you will be asked if you want to create a \"legacy\" style wallet, this is not needed so just click \"next\" Now PKT Electrum is going to create a seed , it takes the form of 12 words and from it your entire wallet is created If you have these 12 special words, you can recover your PKT even if your computer is lost or damaged If someone else gets access to these 12 words, they can steal all of your PKT It is recommended that you write this on paper and keep in a safe place. After you have written your seed, you will be asked to type it back in, the fast way to do this is by copy/paste to a text pad Now you'll be asked to write it back in, you can copy it from the text pad Make sure you really stored your seed on paper, we do not recommend storing it on any electronic device . Now you will need to pick a passphrase for your wallet This passphrase encrypts your wallet, protecting your PKT even if your computer is stolen Unlike your seed, the passphrase is useless without the wallet file We recommend using https://www.useapassphrase.com/ to pick a strong passphrase for you You can store your passphrase on your phone to have easy access Congratulations, you now have a PKT wallet! It will require about 5 minutes to synchronize with the PKT blockchain, but you can still use it while this is happening. Receiving PKT \u00b6 To receive coins, you need to create a new PKT address Click the \"Receive\" tab Type a description for the purpose of receiving the coins, this will appear in the notification when you get paid Set the expiration, if this is not an invoice , you can choose \"never\" After you click \"Request\", your wallet will create a new address and copy it to your clipboard so you can send it to the person paying you (or transfer money to your new wallet) When PKT gets sent to your new address, you will get a notification. It says \"unconfirmed\" because the transaction has not yet been included in the history of the blockchain. Once your transaction has been included in the blockchain, this icon will change to a clock and then after a few minutes, a checkmark Congratulations, you have received your first PKT Sending PKT \u00b6 To pay PKT to someone else, click on the Send tab and paste the address to be paid Type a description of the payment, this is just for you, it will not be sent to the person you are paying Enter the amount to be paid Click Pay You will be prompted to enter your wallet passphrase in order to decrypt the wallet for one brief moment to send the PKT Every transaction requires a fee for inclusion in the blockchain, this is a very small cost: 132 nPKT is one hundred and thirty two nano-PKT (that means billionths , i.e. 0.000000132 PKT) After you enter your passphrase and click \"send\", you will see a transaction ID , this set of numbers and letters uniquely identifies your transaction and can be used to view it in the block explorer. Just like when receiving, your transaction will appear first as \"unconfirmed\" and then later it will switch to a clock when it has been included in the blockchain. After waiting a few minutes, you will see a clock and then later a checkmark indicating your transaction has been included in the blockchain When people consider a transaction to be \"complete\" depends on the merchant, but in general it should be considered to be ok once it switches from \"unconfirmed\" to the clock icon. Congratulations, you've sent PKT! About Units \u00b6 Each PKT is made up of 1000 milli-PKT, denoted mPKT Each milli-PKT is sub-divided into 1000 micro-PKT, denoted uPKT Each micro-PKT is sub-divided into 1000 nano-PKT, denoted nPKT Advanced usage \u00b6 Recover from seed \u00b6 You can recover a PKT Electrum wallet from the seed you were given when you set it up. To do this follow the same instructions as for any other Electrum wallet: https://bitcoinelectrum.com/restoring-your-standard-wallet-from-seed/ Note that recovery from seed will not work to import addresses from other wallets such as a Gridnode. Multi-signature \u00b6 Setting up multi-signature in PKT Electrum is the same as with Bitcoin Electrum so you can follow this tutorial: https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multisig.html How it works \u00b6 PKT Electrum is significantly similar to Bitcoin Electrum. It contacts one of a pool of community operated electrumx servers. Instead of syncing the entire chain it requests information about its addresses from the electrumx server and only downloads enough of the blockchain to verify that the electrumx server is not trying to trick it. In practice this means the wallet needs to check the proof of work and sync the block headers but not the rest of the blocks. Since PKT uses PacketCrypt proof of work, the work verification needs to be different. PacketCrypt headers are fairly large, between 4KB and 16KB, even at only 4KB each they make up 2.1GB of data per year. To maintain security without downloading an unacceptably large amount of data, PKT Electrum downloads only a small number of PacketCrypt proofs near the tip of the chain. If the wallet only downloaded (say) the most recent 100 PacketCrypt proofs, an attacking electrumx server would know exactly how many blocks it needed to mine in order to create a convincing fake chain, PKT Electrum makes this more difficult by using statistical verification. Statistical Verification \u00b6 PKT Electrum makes the job of an attacker hard by asking for an unpredictable random set of PacketCrypt proofs, the chance of any give block being verified is based on the distance between the tip of the chain and that block. The chance is defined as MIN(100%, K / distance_from_tip) where K is a constant which we set at 20 to make PKT Electrum verify around 200 blocks total. With K = 20 , the first 20 blocks have a 100% chance of being verified. * block 21 has a 95% chance * block 25 has an 80% chance * block 50 has a 40% chance * block 80 has a 25% chance The distribution of likelyhood of verifying a block is shown by this chart: Running an ElectrumX server \u00b6 If you would like to participate in running your own ElectrumX server to help the PKT Electrum network, you can do so using a simple Docker command. Check out the Docker PKT Electrumx project for more information about how to run an instance.","title":"PKT electrum"},{"location":"electrum/#pkt-electrum","text":"Important Electrum is a good lightweight wallet for making and receiving payments, but it lacks scalability and is not appropriate for mining , if you are interested in mining PKT, see pktwallet .","title":"PKT electrum"},{"location":"electrum/#first-setup","text":"","title":"First setup"},{"location":"electrum/#macos","text":"Download the file ending with .dmg from the latest PKT Electrum Releases Open Finder Double-click on your Downloads folder and find and click on electrum-pkt-4.0.2.dmg A new window will open with the PKT Electrum app, click and drag it into your Applications folder Press Command+Space to open your Spotlight Search and type PKT Electrum, when you see the PKT Electrum app, press the Enter key to open it.

It contacts one of a pool of community operated electrumx servers. Instead of syncing the entire chain it requests information about its addresses from the electrumx server and only downloads enough of the blockchain to verify that the electrumx server is not trying to trick it. In practice this means the wallet needs to check the proof of work and sync the block headers but not the rest of the blocks. Since PKT uses PacketCrypt proof of work, the work verification needs to be different. PacketCrypt headers are fairly large, between 4KB and 16KB, even at only 4KB each they make up 2.1GB of data per year. To maintain security without downloading an unacceptably large amount of data, PKT Electrum downloads only a small number of PacketCrypt proofs near the tip of the chain. If the wallet only downloaded (say) the most recent 100 PacketCrypt proofs, an attacking electrumx server would know exactly how many blocks it needed to mine in order to create a convincing fake chain, PKT Electrum makes this more difficult by using statistical verification.","title":"How it works"},{"location":"electrum/#statistical-verification","text":"PKT Electrum makes the job of an attacker hard by asking for an unpredictable random set of PacketCrypt proofs, the chance of any give block being verified is based on the distance between the tip of the chain and that block.

Since PKT is completely decentralized, with no central company, foundation or investors behind the project, the Network Steward is able to provide perpetual funding for development. As part of the consensus rules of the PKT blockchain, the publicly visible Network Steward wallet address receives 20% of every newly mined block. 100% of the funds are mandated to be paid out in the form of grants towards funding the Network Steward\u2019s areas of interest, including open-source technology development of the PKT Network. Unlike a pre-mine or founder's fee, the recipient of the Network Steward payout can be changed by a PoS vote. All coins that are not allocated within 129,600 blocks (~3 months) are automatically burned. More than 13% of the mined coins have been burned through 2022.

How does the Network Steward Operate? \u00b6 The persons in custody of the Network Steward wallet periodically meet to award grants in accordance with a strict criteria and mandate. The current mandate is that funds are to be used for: Financing the development of open source software, technology documentation and education resources for the PKT Network and community. Lobbying for an improved regulator environment for small network operators and more generally, to promote internet freedom, privacy, and decentralized internet access. Purchasing property such as proprietary software or radio frequency spectrum rights in order to put these things in the commons. It is the belief of the PKT blockchain founding developers that any unaccountable authority, no matter how benevolent, will eventually fall victim to corruption, inefficiency or simple failure to innovate. Because of this, the PKT blockchain has an impeachment solution whereby every holder of PKT is able to cast a vote to impeach the Network Steward so a new Network Steward can take its place. Impeachment is not an insignificant event. For it to occur, it requires more than a 50% of the total PKT ever mined to \u201cVoteFor\u201d impeachment. If impeachment does occur, what follows is an automatic vote count and a change to the Network Steward address. How are Grants Awarded? \u00b6 Grants are awarded based on a funding criteria that is outlined on the Network Steward Github [here]. You start by socializing what you want to do with the community (try PKT.Chat, Discord or Telegram). When you have rough consensus, you move that conversation to a formal proposal. There are currently two ways to propose a project to the PKT Network Steward. If your project is large and has the benefit of accountants to be able to verify that the money has been spent appropriately, you can make a proposal directly to the Network Steward through its github [here]. Click [here] to submit a proposal Click [here] to download the submission template The Network Steward opens calls with a specified budget from time to time. Anyone can apply during these open calls. The Network Steward meets several times per year to review submitted projects. The minutes of these meetings are published in the github repository, along with the ongoing project statuses. Every transaction made by the Network Steward can be seen in the block explorer and is referred to in the Network Steward's github repository explaining the project that was funded. To make a proposal, you must create a pull request to the github repository and name it according to the naming convention defined in the repository readme. This adds a new project markdown file, as per the project template. Getting a proposal accepted is much like getting a pull request merged into a project. If you want to propose a smaller project and have the accounting and official reporting managed for you, you can propose to the User Operated Internet fund [here], which is funded by the Network Steward and administered by NLnet. NLnet is a well respected public benefit organization that is experienced at managing technology development projects. Network Steward Voting \u00b6 How voting works \u00b6 A vote consists of one two parts, VoteFor and VoteAgainst. VoteAgainst is a vote for impeachment, while VoteFor is a vote for who should become network steward in the event of an impeachment. A network steward is represented as a transaction output script rather than a script encoded key. An easy way to get the script for a given address is to pay some money to it and then explore the raw transaction and copy the output. Exploring a coinbase transaction we can see the output being paid to the network steward https://explorer.pkt.cash/address/ and the script for this output is 0020d5c1005c0d4012d3ae2672319e7f9eb15a57516aeefabbbc062265f67e308f2 If we double-check by querying pktd to find out what is the network steward, we will see that it shows the script that was paid to. So if we wanted, for instance, to change the network steward to https://explorer.pkt.cash/address/pGzmtW4Q2v4AWHcX8TYGqG5c1Eh5Ykg6fX, we would want to vote for the corresponding script 76a9147d9df4279212fd7def4c47abf2d5f3a6c6eaf4ae88ac and of course we probably want to vote against the current network steward as well.

Announcement miners running PacketCrypt upload small, difficult to compress (1KB) messages called announcements to block miners. Block miners, otherwise known as PKT mining pools, must maximize the number of announcements they collect for each block. To accomplish this, PKT mining pools can get a discount on the difficulty of the work they must do by coordinating with community announcement miners and fairly paying announcement miners in PKT Cash to continuously supply them with fresh announcements. Optimal mining results are achieved through this cooperation between miners. The result is a fully decentralized network topography that is powered by the people.

The project supports open internet access and scaling the decentralized web. The PKT project supports the core vision that basic, censorship-resistant internet access should be globally accessible. Rather than pay centralized companies for internet access, it\u2019s designed so basic access can be free and people can pay providers when they need fast speeds. PKT utilizes the cjdns routing protocol to enable a decentralized, censorship-resistant, high-speed data network. The PKT Network is a completely sovereign part of the internet, which is accessible via VPN. Anyone can build censorship-resistant websites in the PKT Network. These websites can use their IPv6 web URL as a PKT payment address, streamlining peer-to-peer payments in the network. There are many reasons why open internet access is important, but none are more fundamental than lowering the barrier to entry so access to information and connectivity is available to everyone. By participating in the PKT project, and holding the PKT cryptocurrency, you are helping restore the founding ethos of the internet: decentralization. Why does PKT exist? \u00b6 Connectivity is humanity\u2019s source of vitality, information and communication. PKT stands for the belief that internet access is a human entitlement. However, lowering the barrier for internet access is not in the best interest of centralized companies, internet service providers (ISP) and governments. Why? Because these entities are motivated by money and power, and their control is diminished if global internet access is free. Additionally, many corporations and governments don\u2019t support free unlimited internet access due to regional or political censorship ideologies or capitalist priorities. Despite the founding principle for the internet to be decentralized, today, internet access is not. It is for these reasons that PKT is designed to usher in a new paradigm of connectivity. This helps realize a new era, where the physical infrastructure of the internet is powered by the people, and accessibility is open and free. How does PKT Expand Internet Access? \u00b6 The PKT project presents an alternative approach to traditional internet service through mesh networking. First, PKT economically incentivizes individuals who have internet access to set up a PKT miner and contribute computer processing and bandwidth to secure the PKT blockchain. Similar to how Bitcoin miners earn BTC as they mine the Bitcoin, PKT miners earn PKT when they mine PKT. Since PKT mining requires bandwidth, this creates a general demand for bandwidth. Second, individuals with bandwidth can set up a cjdns node. Cjdns is the mesh networking protocol that enables the high speed data infrastructure for the PKT Network. As more people connect, this builds a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. Third, individuals can share mesh network internet access to the PKT Network. This internet access functions similar to a wifi access point. However, all connectivity is end-to-end encrypted. Wifi access point operators can choose to offer free access or paid access. The objective of the PKT Network is to decouple the physical aspect of deploying and maintaining internet infrastructure (such as overhead and undersea cables), from the business and technical aspects of internet service such as billing, network engineering, and support. This way anyone can safely and securely become an internet provider via mesh networking, thus expanding internet access worldwide. The fundamental value of dividing these internet service efforts is to empower everyday people to cover the cost of deploying and maintaining mesh network wifi access points. This ultimately lowers the cost of providing localized internet access and drives competition in the multi-trillion dollar annual internet industry. This can result in PKT\u2019s mission to get the next billion people online. How can PKT Accomplish Its Goals? \u00b6 Community projects can achieve the best results when focused on use cases, utility and community participation. When inspiring community participation, three core reasons people may take action: necessity they believe strongly they are being paid In the mission to extend internet access and expand the decentralized web, PKT economically incentivizes individuals to participate. Additionally, many contributors truly believe in the mission to connect the unconnected. Since PKT is a fully decentralized community project, like Bitcoin, everyone in the community is part of the project team. There is no central authority or centralized infrastructure. However, there are many businesses and contributors in the PKT ecosystem who are developing the [roadmap]. This fosters the decentralized nature of the project. Visit the Ecosystem page [here] to see a (non-exhaustive) list of the major projects and contributors. How does the PKT blockchain work? \u00b6 PKT is the world\u2019s first and only bandwidth-hard proof-of-work blockchain. Anyone with internet access can install the mining software called PacketCrypt and start mining to earn PKT Cash. Just as Bitcoin introduced the dawn of a new era of digital money, PKT is introducing a new paradigm for how people can use their internet resources to expand internet accessibility.

First, PKT economically incentivizes individuals who have internet access to set up a PKT miner and contribute computer processing and bandwidth to secure the PKT blockchain. Similar to how Bitcoin miners earn BTC as they mine the Bitcoin, PKT miners earn PKT when they mine PKT. Since PKT mining requires bandwidth, this creates a general demand for bandwidth. Second, individuals with bandwidth can set up a cjdns node. Cjdns is the mesh networking protocol that enables the high speed data infrastructure for the PKT Network. As more people connect, this builds a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. Third, individuals can share mesh network internet access to the PKT Network. This internet access functions similar to a wifi access point. However, all connectivity is end-to-end encrypted. Wifi access point operators can choose to offer free access or paid access. The objective of the PKT Network is to decouple the physical aspect of deploying and maintaining internet infrastructure (such as overhead and undersea cables), from the business and technical aspects of internet service such as billing, network engineering, and support. This way anyone can safely and securely become an internet provider via mesh networking, thus expanding internet access worldwide. The fundamental value of dividing these internet service efforts is to empower everyday people to cover the cost of deploying and maintaining mesh network wifi access points. This ultimately lowers the cost of providing localized internet access and drives competition in the multi-trillion dollar annual internet industry. This can result in PKT\u2019s mission to get the next billion people online.","title":"How does PKT Expand Internet Access?"},{"location":"learn/pkt/#how-can-pkt-accomplish-its-goals","text":"Community projects can achieve the best results when focused on use cases, utility and community participation.

Miners collaborate with one another by sending small messages (called Announcements ) and the sending of these messages requires a large amount of bandwidth . Miners who are working in collaboration with one another are members of a mining pool, therefore all mining of PacketCrypt is done in pools. PacketCrypt mining is split into two distinct stages: Announcement Mining - Using your CPU to create Announcements Block Mining - Collecting Announcements from Announcement Miners and using them to mine blocks Block mining is typically done at the mining pool's datacenter, however Announcement mining can be done from anywhere. How to Announcement mine \u00b6 There are a number of options available when it comes to installing the PacketCrpyt announcement miner. Choose whichever best suits your technical ability: 1. Install a Pre-built Binary \u00b6 Pre-built packetcrypt binaries (for linux) or installation packages (for macos) and archives (for windows) can be downloaded from packetcrypt releases page . For windows , download the zip archive suffixed with -windows.zip and extract its content. For macos , download the package suffixed with .pkg and click on its icon in the Finder for installation. For linux , download the binary suffixed with -linux_amd64 and rename it packetcrypt . If you're on Arch linux or Manjaro, you can install the packetcrypt AUR package 2. Deploy a Docker Image \u00b6 There is a PacketCrypt Docker image available, which can be used for announcement mining. To install: Download and install Docker for your operating system. Download the PacketCrypt Docker image: $ docker pull thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt There are also PacketCrypt Docker images built without the portable flag ( --no-portable ) which may increase the performance of the announcement mining while reducing CPU compatibility. One such image (compiled on AMD 5950x) is available at thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt-amd64 . Additionally, for ARM devices such as Raspberry Pi, there is an image available at thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt-arm64 . The arm64 image will also work on Apple silicon such as the M1 and M2 chips. Run the container similar to the commands described in the Begin Announcement Mining section, except replace this part of the command: $ packetcrypt with this command to run PacketCrypt from Docker: $ docker run thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt The final command will be formatted like this: $ docker run thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt ann -p <your_wallet_address> <pool_1> More information can be found at the PacketCrypt DockerHub page 3. Build From Source \u00b6 Building from source will generally offer the best mining performance but requires more technical knowledge than the previous two options. First install rust if you haven't, see: rustup git clone https://github.com/cjdelisle/packetcrypt_rs cd packetcrypt_rs cargo build --release See the PacketCrypt GitHub repository for more detailed instructions. Begin Announcement Mining \u00b6 Important You cannot mine into the electrum wallet , You can only mine into the Command Line Wallet , the Pkt.World Wallet or the Mac GUI Wallet . To begin mining, you will need the address of your wallet and you will need to choose a pool. There are two ways to configure the announcement miner; by using CLI parameters or by using a configuration file: Using the CLI packetcrypt ann -p <your_wallet_address> pool_1 [pool_2 pool_3 pool_4] [or for windows] packetcrypt.exe ann -p <your_wallet_address> pool_1 [pool_2 pool_3 pool_4] Using a Configuration File A configuration file must be in JSON format. The file can be loaded from the local filesystem or from a web-accessible location. Any CLI parameters used will overide the corresponding settings in the configuration file. Example config.json: { \"payment_addr\": \"<your_wallet_address>\", \"pools\": [ \"pool_1\", \"pool_2\", \"pool_3\", \"pool_4\" ] } packetcrypt ann -c \"./config.json\" [or] packetcrypt ann -c \"https://example.com/config.json\" [or for windows] packetcrypt.exe ann -c \"./config.json\" [or] packetcrypt.exe ann -c \"https://example.com/config.json\" Announcement mining can be done into a single pool or multiple pools. When you announcement mine into multiple pools, you will be paid by each pool that you submit announcements to. pool_1 is the pool running the highest difficulty. If you notice problems, you can test listing the pools in a different order. The number of pools you mine into is at your discretion. If a pool is down or malfunctioning you will notice the pool is not mining at [100%] in your mining feed and you can choose to remove the under-performing or malfunctioning pool. How to install a PKT miner on Mac \u00b6 Install the Zulu or CLI PKT Wallet from https://docs.pkt.cash Download the PacketCrypt.pkg for mac Open your Terminal Install Rust by entering in the command: $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf * https://sh.rustup.rs | sh Press 1 to confirm Enter the command: $ sudo install make Enter the command: $ git clone https://github.com/cjdelisle/packetcrypt_rs Enter the command: $ cd packetcrypt_rs Enter the command: $ ~/.cargo/bin/cargo build --release Enter the command: $ ./target/release/packetcrypt ann -p [your PKT Wallet Address] [pool 1] [pool 2] [pool 3] [pool 4] Choosing Pools to mine in \u00b6 You can mine in as many pools as you have the bandwidth to supply. The same data will be uploaded so your CPU is only used once. Currently the pools which are regularly winning blocks include: Pkteer: http://pool.pkteer.com PKTPool: http://pool.pktpool.io PktWorld: http://pool.pkt.world Zetahash (f.k.a. Srizbi): https://stratum.zetahash.com In general the recommendation is to list the pool with highest difficulty in the first position to ensure your announcements will be accepted, as the standardized policy is to accept announcements of a higher difficulty for pools with a lower base difficulty. In some cases the rewards might vary depending on the pool order regardless of difficulty, subject to custom policies implemented by the respective pools. (Check the relevant channels on Discord for current pool statuses) You should test your daily earnings on each pool to see which one is best. Your mining revenue depends on how much each pool allocates towards announcement miners as well as how much hardware they are using in-house. The pools are winning different blocks and if you mine to just one pool, you're not getting any payment from the others when they win a block. It's the same with mining to a pool that is not winning any blocks. Limiting System Resource Usage \u00b6 Limiting the system resources available to Packetcrypt may negatively effect your mining power but can be useful to conserve resources for other processess. Limit CPU Usage \u00b6 Announcement mining is a resource intensive process. By default, Packetcrypt will use 100% of the available CPU resources. CPU usage can be limited by assigning a limited number of threads to packetcrypt using the -t CLI parameter or \"threads\" key if using a configuration file. Example of assigning four (4) threads to Packetcrypt: packetcrypt ann -p <your_wallet_address> pool_1 [pool_2 pool_3 pool_4] -t 4 or { \"threads\" 4 } Limit Bandwidth Usage \u00b6 Bandwidth usage is directly related to two main factors: 1 - Mining difficulty of the primary pool (the first pool listed in Packetcrypt pool configuration) A lower difficulty means higher bandwidth usage 2 - The number of pools mined Packetcrypt will send the same Announcements to each pool mined Bandwidth usage can therefore be limited by selecting a higher difficulty pool as the primary pool and/or by mining to fewer pools. Block Mining & Running a Pool \u00b6 Because each block miner must use as much bandwidth as all of the announcement miners combined , block mining is typically done at the location of the pool. Even a pool operator who wanted to support external block mining would find that the pool itself would need enough upload bandwidth to match all of the block miners - which would be completely untenable. If you are interested in block mining, contact the pool operator and discuss sending hardware to their location. Starting your own pool requires setting up a number of services: pktd node (one or more) - One pktd instance is required for the Master to function, each of the Block Handlers may optionally use separate pktd nodes. Master (one) - This node coordinates all of the others and provides work files and configuration Ann Handler (one or more) - These are high performance nodes which accept announcements from the announcement miners in the network, they also provide announcements to the block miners. As you scale up the amount of bandwidth in the pool, you will need to add more Ann handlers. Block Miner (one or more) - These nodes download announcements from the announcement handlers and use them in the mining process to mine blocks. Block Handlers (one or more) - These nodes receive \"block shares\" from the block miners and submit blocks if Paymaker (1) - This node receives updates from the Ann Handlers and Block Handlers and keeps track of who should be paid. The Paymaker sends configuration to the pktd node which is used by the Master in order to make the pool pay out the announcement and block miners PacketCrypt Data Flow \u00b6 \u2588 Orange: Announcements are sent from the Announcement miners to the Ann Handlers and then to the Block miners \u2588 Blue: Block shares are sent from block miners to Block Handler(s) \u2588 Purple: Winning blocks are submitted by the Block Handler(s) to pktd and the PKT network \u2588 Pink: Block Handlers and Ann Handlers inform Paymaker of work done by announcement and block miners \u2588 Green: Paymaker configures pktd instance to create blocks which pay the people who have been mining \u2588 Brown: Master gets block templates from pktd instance Black dotted line: All nodes request configuration and block templates from Master node More Information and PacketCrypt Pool Code \u00b6 The code and documentation for running a pool is available on the C / nodejs version of the PacketCrypt project, the new Rust version only contains Announcement Miner and Announcement Handlers. Announcement Difficulty \u00b6 PacketCrypt is designed in such a way that a mining pool can double its effective power by: Doubling the total block mining computation effort Doubling the total announcement mining computation effort, or Doubling the amount of bandwidth between announcement miners and the pool The way that a pool operator limits the amount of bandwidth flowing into the pool, to prevent overloading of the network, is by setting what is known as the announcement difficulty . The announcement difficulty for a pool specifies how much work must be done on an announcement in order for the announcement to be accepted and paid out by the pool. Announcement difficulty serves to slow down the announcement miners to protect the pool's network. In general, doubling the announcement difficulty will halve the amount of bandwidth used by the pool and will also halve the pool's overall mining power, with a limit that setting the announcement difficulty lower than 2 does not bring any additional value. To explain why it works like this, we need to examine the PacketCrypt algorithm rules and the in particular how the block mining software decides which announcements to use when attempting to mine a block. Announcement Set Selection \u00b6 PacketCrypt algorithm allows block miners to perform less work if they are able to prove that they had a certain number of \"high value\" announcements in memory at the time of mining, the exact ratio of actual work a block miner must do to the amount of work the PKT blockchain requires is called the power multipler . For a block miner seeking to optimize their power multiplier, every announcement has a particular level of utility value which is based on the amount of work that was done by the announcement miner (announcement difficulty) and how old the announcement is. We call this the effective difficulty . The effective difficulty of an announcement starts off as the actual difficulty of the work done to mine it and then decreases by half every block-period until it is less than 1 and the announcement is no longer usable for mining. The block mining software selects a subset of announcements which which will give it the best power multiplier based on the PacketCrypt algorithm: power_multiplier = min(effective_difficulty) * ann_count ** 2 The min(effective_difficulty) is the effective difficulty of the \"least valuable\" announcement that is being mined with. Lets assume that announcement miners are providing a steady supply of 1000 announcements per block-period and all announcements have an initial announcement difficulty of 128. The block mining software can choose to mine with 1000 announcements at 128 effective difficulty, or with 2000 announcements at 64 effective difficulty, or with 3000 announcements at 32 effective difficulty and so on. The best choice is to use the previous three block periods which provides a power multiplier that is 225% higher than that of using just the most recent 1 period worth of announcements. This curve is the same no matter what difficulty we are starting with. Optimal Difficulty Curve \u00b6 Knowing that the optimal announcement set is all of those announcements mined over the past 3 block periods, we can compute the overall power of a pool as the announcement difficulty is raised. At announcement difficulty 1, announcements cannot be used for more than 1 block, but if we imagine that the announcement mining community can produce 1000 announcements per block at difficulty 1 then we can reason that the power multiplier will be 1000 ** 2 or 1 million. At difficulty 2 we can expect the announcement miners will produce 500 announcements per block period but since 2 block periods can be used, the power multiplier is the same. At difficulty 4, the announcement miners will produce 250 announcements per block period and they will be valid for 3 block periods making the power multiplier 750 ** 2 or 562,500. From here, the power output of the power multiplier of the optimal announcement set halves for each doubling of the announcement difficulty, making the optimal difficulty 2 . FAQ for ANN Miners \u00b6 What does overflow mean? \u00b6 When the ann handler receives an announcement, it puts it into a queue, when the queue fills up it responds overflow immediately. The queue can become long, so you may receive \"operation timed out\" you're still being paid, when you receive \"overflow\" you are not being paid. Unfortunately, you may also receive \"operation timed out\" because the handler is unresponsive, it's not obvious which is the reason from looking at the logs. For example, what you will see in the AnnMiner Logs: 1618394538 INFO annmine.rs:519 467 Ke/s 28.56Mb/s overflow: [0, 0, 3072, 0] uploading: [0, 0, 17632, 0] accept/reject: [26932/0, 0/0, 4856/0, 796/0] - goodrate: [100%, 100%, 61%, 100%] 467 Ke/s 467 kilo-encryptions (thousands of encryptions) per second of mining power. 28.56Mb/s Total upload bandwidth (to all pools - combined) overflow: [0, 0, 3072, 0] Overflowed the internal queue of the ann miner, before it was even able to upload to the pool, one number for each pool you're mining to. 3072 Number of anns which are not uploaded to pool #3. uploading [0, 0, 17632, 0] Number of anns currently in-flight in active http requests, again 3rd pool is a problem, others are doing well (in this example). accept/reject [26932/0, 0/0, 4856/0, 796/0] Anns accepted/rejected by each pool, these numbers are based on the previous 10 seconds, pool #2 is giving a zero accepted which might be an issue, keep watching the next message 10 seconds later for another update. goodrate [100%, 100%, 61%, 100%] Goodrate = number of anns accepted divided by number of anns produced.","title":"Mining"},{"location":"mining/#mining","text":"PacketCrypt is a bandwidth hard proof of work , this means it requires lots of bandwidth to mine.

Lets assume that announcement miners are providing a steady supply of 1000 announcements per block-period and all announcements have an initial announcement difficulty of 128. The block mining software can choose to mine with 1000 announcements at 128 effective difficulty, or with 2000 announcements at 64 effective difficulty, or with 3000 announcements at 32 effective difficulty and so on. The best choice is to use the previous three block periods which provides a power multiplier that is 225% higher than that of using just the most recent 1 period worth of announcements. This curve is the same no matter what difficulty we are starting with.","title":"Announcement Set Selection"},{"location":"mining/#optimal-difficulty-curve","text":"Knowing that the optimal announcement set is all of those announcements mined over the past 3 block periods, we can compute the overall power of a pool as the announcement difficulty is raised. At announcement difficulty 1, announcements cannot be used for more than 1 block, but if we imagine that the announcement mining community can produce 1000 announcements per block at difficulty 1 then we can reason that the power multiplier will be 1000 ** 2 or 1 million. At difficulty 2 we can expect the announcement miners will produce 500 announcements per block period but since 2 block periods can be used, the power multiplier is the same. At difficulty 4, the announcement miners will produce 250 announcements per block period and they will be valid for 3 block periods making the power multiplier 750 ** 2 or 562,500. From here, the power output of the power multiplier of the optimal announcement set halves for each doubling of the announcement difficulty, making the optimal difficulty 2 .","title":"Optimal Difficulty Curve"},{"location":"mining/#faq-for-ann-miners","text":"","title":"FAQ for ANN Miners"},{"location":"mining/#what-does-overflow-mean","text":"When the ann handler receives an announcement, it puts it into a queue, when the queue fills up it responds overflow immediately.

As the AnnHandler will be run on the same machine as the BlkMiner you need to make sure there are no over-lapping port bindings. If you plan to allow external AnnMiners (AnnMiners not on your LAN to mine against your pool, the url's placed in the AnnHandlers list, should be externally resolvable. The address that is advertized for accessing this ann handler (external address) If running locally use: url: 'http://10.0.16.3:8081','http://10.0.16.4:8081' If allowing external annminers use a resolved address such as: url: 'http://ann1.pktpool.io','http://ann2.pktpool.io' Replace the url with your own. config.blkHandlers \u00b6 Information: config.blkHandlers is a list of json object, with an object for each individual annhandler you would like to run, each ann handler will require it's own individual port.

This number is effectively a bandwidth divisor, every time you double this number you will reduce your bandwidth by a factor of two. annMinWork: Util.annWorkToTarget(128), Average number of shares per block, reducing this number will reduce load on your block handlers, but increasing it will allow payment to be spread more evenly between block miners. This wants to be set to a higher number than one, for the purpose of constantly testing that the block miners are making valid shares. You may have a block miner sitting for hours without a share and then when it wins one, it can become invalid because of misconfiguration shareWorkDivisor: 4, Which versions of announcements we will accept annVersions: [1], Request that ann miners mine announcements that are this many blocks old. Announcements contain a commitment of the most recent block hash but they need 3 blocks to \"mature\" before they can be used The point of this is so that PacketCrypt is about bandwidth, not latency. But there is a risk: If there is a surge then you are going to be starved for announcements When you are starved, you will have few usable anns which causes a slow-down in mining and the announcements which are being submitted are not usable. When you win a few blocks, those announcements become usable and you surge, which causes you to go back into starvation again. This should be set to either: 0 Which means the announcements you are receiving are used instantly 3 Which means you are waiting for the announcements to mature before using them. If running your own AnnMiners, it is advisable to set this to 0, and add the --mineold 3 to some of your AnnMiner startups on the CLI.

A complete sync from a new installation can take 12+ hours. During this time, the balance in your wallet will not be accurate and you will be unable to transact. You may, however, proceed with creating an address while syncing, as detailed below. Creating a New PKT Address \u00b6 While pktwallet is running in the background (or in another terminal), use the following command: ./bin/pktctl --wallet getnewaddress You should see a series of numbers and letters beginning with pkt1 . This is your newly created PKT address which you can use for receiving coins. If you need to view it after creation, the address, along with the balance, can be seen in the output from running: ./bin/pktctl --wallet getaddressbalances 1 1 NOTE : Every time you use getnewaddress , the address you receive must be remembered by pktwallet forever. So, only use it when you actually need an address.

Make sure to save your passphrase in a safe place. Write down your wallet seed. It is very important to keep your seed in a safe place To generate a new PKT address, click Wallet. Generate new address To begin mining using the PKT World Wallet, click Miner Start Mining How to install a CLI Wallet \u00b6 If you already have a wallet created on your computer called wallet.db you will need to create a new wallet by following these steps: Download pktd-v1.5.1-macos.pkg Run the installation Open Terminal Enter the command: $ cd pktd Enter the command: $ ~/pktd/bin/pktwallet --create --wallet xxxx xxxx is the name of the wallet i.e. wallet personal Make sure to write this down for your notes Enter passphrase or leave empty Make sure to write this down for you notes Do NOT add additional layer of security Copy down your seed. If your wallet is destroyed, you can recover it as long as you have this seed and your wallet passphrase.

Some functions will be limited until pktwallet is fully synchronized. Some functions require the wallet being unlocked before executing. Getting Your Balance \u00b6 You can check your current PKT balance using pktctl or you can check the balances of each of your addresses if you have more than one. ./bin/pktctl --wallet getbalance or: ./bin/pktctl --wallet getaddressbalances getaddressbalances by itself will not show 0 balance addresses you may have created. To show these addresses, use: ./bin/pktctl --wallet getaddressbalances 1 1 For more explanation of the meaning of the output of getaddressbalances , use: ./bin/pktctl --wallet help getaddressbalances Unlocking Wallet \u00b6 While many functions can be performed while the wallet is locked, other functions first require the wallet to be unlocked, including sending PKT and folding. The passphrase used to unlock the wallet was set when creating the wallet. To unlock your wallet for 120 seconds (this can be changed to your liking), use: ./bin/pktctl --wallet walletpassphrase <passphrase you used when creating wallet> 120 To keep your wallet unlocked, use: ./bin/pktctl --wallet walletpassphrase <passphrase you used when creating wallet> 0 If using 0 as in the previous example to keep your wallet indefinitely unlocked, it will stay unlocked until you either restart pktwallet or run: ./bin/pktctl --wallet walletlock NOTE: Special characters (e.g., !, #, & *) in your passphrase may be incorrectly interpreted by your shell. You may need to wrap your passphrase in quotes. ./bin/pktctl --wallet walletpassphrase 'suP3r_S3cReT^P@s5W0Rd!' 120 Sending PKT \u00b6 You can send PKT using the sendtoaddress command, but first you must unlock your wallet for sending, as shown in the previous step. To send cjd a 10 PKT tip: ./bin/pktctl --wallet sendtoaddress pkt1qt8xe7dwpelngtcpsgn5nkj3pwwdm7gf3l4auax 10 Sending PKT from Specific Address \u00b6 pktwallet gives you control over which addresses are used for making a payment. This means you can keep different PKT in your wallet separate, for example separating business transactions from personal transactions. NOTE : PKT is not a \"privacy coin\", so transactions are still shown in the blockchain like with Bitcoin. Unlock wallet: ./bin/pktctl --wallet walletpassphrase <passphrase you used when creating wallet> 60 Send 10 PKT to \"their address\" from \"your address\": ./bin/pktctl --wallet sendfrom <their address> 10 '[\"<your address>\"]' Notice the '[\" . This is because the last argument is actually a quoted JSON array . This means you can use multiple addresses as the source of a payment. For example: ./bin/pktctl --wallet sendfrom <their address> 10 '[\"<your address>\", \"<your other address>\"]' Windows users require unique formatting for command prompt: pktctl.exe --wallet sendfrom <their address> 10 [\\\"<your address>\\\"] Sweeping an Address \u00b6 With pktwallet, sending 0 PKT has special significance in that it will send \"as much PKT as possible\". To sweep <old address> address into <new address> , you can use the following command: ./bin/pktctl --wallet sendfrom <new address> 0 '[\"<old address>\"]' Windows: pktctl.exe --wallet sendfrom <new address> 0 [\\\"<old address>\\\"] NOTE : Sweeping an address will send as much PKT as possible , which is not necessarily all PKT in that address. You may need to sweep multiple times before the address is empty. Folding Coins \u00b6 If you are the recipient of many transactions, such as is the case in mining, you may not be able to spend all of them at once. This is similar to someone who is paid in pennies having a difficult time using the pennies to buy a car. To solve this issue, you can consolidate all of the coins which were paid to you by folding . Folding is sweeping an address to itself . Just like in sweeping, you may need to run the command many times before you have completely folded. See FAQs for more detail. For example: ./bin/pktctl --wallet sendfrom <address> 0 '[\"<address>\"]' Windows: pktctl.exe --wallet sendfrom <address> 0 [\\\"<address>\\\"] Alternative GUI Wallets \u00b6 Electrum for PKT (Windows, MacOS, Linux) NOTE: Electrum is not appropriate for mining. Do NOT mine into an electrum wallet! PKT World Wallet (Windows) Zulu Wallet (MacOS) FAQs \u00b6 I have several machines mining, do I need the wallet running on each machine? \u00b6 NO! In fact, the wallet doesn't need to be running at all to mine, but you do need to ensure you have control of the address you are mining to. Should I leave pktwallet running? \u00b6 It is not a requirement to have pktwallet running to mine. However, if you leave it running, it will stay synced. This will save time when performing pktctl functions, such as folding and sending coins. If pktwallet has not been running for some time, it will need time to sync up to the current block from the time it last ran. As a safety precaution, don't forget to lock your wallet if you do keep it running. How often should I fold and why? \u00b6 The purpose of folding is to turn all your small payments (such as from mining) into quickly and easily spendable coins. If you are multi-pool mining and have rewards in every block, you will have roughly 1440 unconsolidated transactions per day - one for each block at a rate of ~ 1 block/min. If you do not fold these transactions, after awhile you'll have a huge amount of transactions to process if you wish to send the sum or portion thereof of these smaller transactions. So, while folding isn't required and will have no impact on mining if you do or do not, you're doing yourself a favor later by keeping the transactions as consolidated as possible. It is typical to fold as much as possible every day or every few days when you think about it, depending on your use case. It can also be scripted. Note that folding is a transaction itself. Depending on how much you have to fold, you may need to run the command many times. You also may need to wait for coins to confirm before folding more. Once the folding command fails or you see a very low number in the outputcount field from running ./bin/pktctl --wallet getaddressbalances 1 1 or on PKT block explorer under Unconsolidated Txns, you have successfully folded the best you can for that point in time.","title":"pktwallet"},{"location":"pktd/pktwallet/#pktwallet","text":"The command line PKT wallet","title":"pktwallet"},{"location":"pktd/pktwallet/#first-time-installation-and-launching","text":"","title":"First Time Installation and Launching"},{"location":"pktd/pktwallet/#download-pktd","text":"","title":"Download pktd"},{"location":"pktd/pktwallet/#microsoft-windows","text":"Download the most recent zip archive suffixed with -windows.zip available from pktd releases page For example: pktd-v1.4.0-windows.zip Unarchive the content of the zip file Open the command prompt and navigate to the bin directory in the extracted archive For Example: cd Downloads\\pktd*\\bin Follow the instructions below but In place of ./bin/pktwallet , use pktwallet.exe In place of ./bin/pktctl , use pktctl.exe","title":"Microsoft Windows"},{"location":"pktd/pktwallet/#macos-and-linux","text":"Download one of the most recent packages available for Linux or MacOS from pktd releases page For example, for pktd-v1.4.0 release: For MacOS , after having downloaded pktd-v1.4.0-macos.pkg , install pktwallet and other utilities by clicking on the package icon in the Finder.

Announcements are transmitted to and collected by block miners to form blocks. This simulates the transmission of data across the network. Announcement miners must maximize their CPU processing power and bandwidth upload speed for the highest yields. Announcement mining can be done from nearly any device that has a CPU processor and access to bandwidth. Also include: Multi-pool mining means submitting the exact same announcements to multiple pools. So if you have the bandwidth available it will always benefit you to mine in all of the major pools. Mining \u00b6 PacketCrypt is a bandwidth hard proof of work , this means it requires lots of bandwidth to mine. Miners collaborate with one another by sending small messages (called Announcements ) and the sending of these messages requires a large amount of bandwidth . Miners who are working in collaboration with one another are members of a mining pool, therefore all mining of PacketCrypt is done in pools. PacketCrypt mining is split into two distinct stages: Announcement Mining - Using your CPU to create Announcements Block Mining - Collecting Announcements from Announcement Miners and using them to mine blocks Block mining is typically done at the mining pool's datacenter, however Announcement mining can be done from anywhere. How to Announcement mine \u00b6 There are a number of options available when it comes to installing the PacketCrpyt announcement miner. Choose whichever best suits your technical ability: 1. Install a Pre-built Binary \u00b6 Pre-built packetcrypt binaries (for linux) or installation packages (for macos) and archives (for windows) can be downloaded from packetcrypt releases page . For windows , download the zip archive suffixed with -windows.zip and extract its content. For macos , download the package suffixed with .pkg and click on its icon in the Finder for installation. For linux , download the binary suffixed with -linux_amd64 and rename it packetcrypt . If you're on Arch linux or Manjaro, you can install the packetcrypt AUR package 2. Deploy a Docker Image \u00b6 There is a PacketCrypt Docker image available, which can be used for announcement mining. To install: Download and install Docker for your operating system. Download the PacketCrypt Docker image: $ docker pull thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt There are also PacketCrypt Docker images built without the portable flag ( --no-portable ) which may increase the performance of the announcement mining while reducing CPU compatibility. One such image (compiled on AMD 5950x) is available at thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt-amd64 . Additionally, for ARM devices such as Raspberry Pi, there is an image available at thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt-arm64 . The arm64 image will also work on Apple silicon such as the M1 and M2 chips. Run the container similar to the commands described in the Begin Announcement Mining section, except replace this part of the command: $ packetcrypt with this command to run PacketCrypt from Docker: $ docker run thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt The final command will be formatted like this: $ docker run thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt ann -p <your_wallet_address> <pool_1> More information can be found at the PacketCrypt DockerHub page 3. Build From Source \u00b6 Building from source will generally offer the best mining performance but requires more technical knowledge than the previous two options. First install rust if you haven't, see: rustup git clone https://github.com/cjdelisle/packetcrypt_rs cd packetcrypt_rs cargo build --release See the PacketCrypt GitHub repository for more detailed instructions. Begin Announcement Mining \u00b6 Important You cannot mine into the electrum wallet , You can only mine into the Command Line Wallet , the Pkt.World Wallet or the Mac GUI Wallet . To begin mining, you will need the address of your wallet and you will need to choose a pool. There are two ways to configure the announcement miner; by using CLI parameters or by using a configuration file: Using the CLI packetcrypt ann -p <your_wallet_address> pool_1 [pool_2 pool_3 pool_4] [or for windows] packetcrypt.exe ann -p <your_wallet_address> pool_1 [pool_2 pool_3 pool_4] Using a Configuration File A configuration file must be in JSON format. The file can be loaded from the local filesystem or from a web-accessible location. Any CLI parameters used will overide the corresponding settings in the configuration file. Example config.json: { \"payment_addr\": \"<your_wallet_address>\", \"pools\": [ \"pool_1\", \"pool_2\", \"pool_3\", \"pool_4\" ] } packetcrypt ann -c \"./config.json\" [or] packetcrypt ann -c \"https://example.com/config.json\" [or for windows] packetcrypt.exe ann -c \"./config.json\" [or] packetcrypt.exe ann -c \"https://example.com/config.json\" Announcement mining can be done into a single pool or multiple pools. When you announcement mine into multiple pools, you will be paid by each pool that you submit announcements to. pool_1 is the pool running the highest difficulty. If you notice problems, you can test listing the pools in a different order. The number of pools you mine into is at your discretion. If a pool is down or malfunctioning you will notice the pool is not mining at [100%] in your mining feed and you can choose to remove the under-performing or malfunctioning pool. How to install a PKT miner on Mac \u00b6 Install the Zulu or CLI PKT Wallet from https://docs.pkt.cash Download the PacketCrypt.pkg for mac Open your Terminal Install Rust by entering in the command: $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf * https://sh.rustup.rs | sh Press 1 to confirm Enter the command: $ sudo install make Enter the command: $ git clone https://github.com/cjdelisle/packetcrypt_rs Enter the command: $ cd packetcrypt_rs Enter the command: $ ~/.cargo/bin/cargo build --release Enter the command: $ ./target/release/packetcrypt ann -p [your PKT Wallet Address] [pool 1] [pool 2] [pool 3] [pool 4] Choosing Pools to mine in \u00b6 You can mine in as many pools as you have the bandwidth to supply. The same data will be uploaded so your CPU is only used once. Currently the pools which are regularly winning blocks include: Pkteer: http://pool.pkteer.com PKTPool: http://pool.pktpool.io PktWorld: http://pool.pkt.world Zetahash (f.k.a. Srizbi): https://stratum.zetahash.com In general the recommendation is to list the pool with highest difficulty in the first position to ensure your announcements will be accepted, as the standardized policy is to accept announcements of a higher difficulty for pools with a lower base difficulty. In some cases the rewards might vary depending on the pool order regardless of difficulty, subject to custom policies implemented by the respective pools. (Check the relevant channels on Discord for current pool statuses) You should test your daily earnings on each pool to see which one is best. Your mining revenue depends on how much each pool allocates towards announcement miners as well as how much hardware they are using in-house. The pools are winning different blocks and if you mine to just one pool, your not getting any payment from the others when they win a block. It's the same with mining to a pool that is not winning any blocks. Limiting System Resource Usage \u00b6 Limiting the system resources available to Packetcrypt may negatively effect your mining power but can be useful to conserve resources for other processess. Limit CPU Usage \u00b6 Announcement mining is a resource intensive process. By default, Packetcrypt will use 100% of the available CPU resources. CPU usage can be limited by assigning a limited number of threads to packetcrypt using the -t CLI parameter or \"threads\" key if using a configuration file. Example of assigning four (4) threads to Packetcrypt: packetcrypt ann -p <your_wallet_address> pool_1 [pool_2 pool_3 pool_4] -t 4 or { \"threads\" 4 } Limit Bandwidth Usage \u00b6 Bandwidth usage is directly related to two main factors: 1 - Mining difficulty of the primary pool (the first pool listed in Packetcrypt pool configuration) A lower difficulty means higher bandwidth usage 2 - The number of pools mined Packetcrypt will send the same Announcements to each pool mined Bandwidth usage can therefore be limited by selecting a higher difficulty pool as the primary pool and/or by mining to fewer pools. Block Mining & Running a Pool \u00b6 Because each block miner must use as much bandwidth as all of the announcement miners combined , block mining is typically done at the location of the pool. Even a pool operator who wanted to support external block mining would find that the pool itself would need enough upload bandwidth to match all of the block miners - which would be completely untenable. If you are interested in block mining, contact the pool operator and discuss sending hardware to their location. Starting your own pool requires setting up a number of services: pktd node (one or more) - One pktd instance is required for the Master to function, each of the Block Handlers may optionally use separate pktd nodes. Master (one) - This node coordinates all of the others and provides work files and configuration Ann Handler (one or more) - These are high performance nodes which accept announcements from the announcement miners in the network, they also provide announcements to the block miners. As you scale up the amount of bandwidth in the pool, you will need to add more Ann handlers. Block Miner (one or more) - These nodes download announcements from the announcement handlers and use them in the mining process to mine blocks. Block Handlers (one or more) - These nodes receive \"block shares\" from the block miners and submit blocks if Paymaker (1) - This node receives updates from the Ann Handlers and Block Handlers and keeps track of who should be paid. The Paymaker sends configuration to the pktd node which is used by the Master in order to make the pool pay out the announcement and block miners PacketCrypt Data Flow \u00b6 \u2588 Orange: Announcements are sent from the Announcement miners to the Ann Handlers and then to the Block miners \u2588 Blue: Block shares are sent from block miners to Block Handler(s) \u2588 Purple: Winning blocks are submitted by the Block Handler(s) to pktd and the PKT network \u2588 Pink: Block Handlers and Ann Handlers inform Paymaker of work done by announcement and block miners \u2588 Green: Paymaker configures pktd instance to create blocks which pay the people who have been mining \u2588 Brown: Master gets block templates from pktd instance Black dotted line: All nodes request configuration and block templates from Master node More Information and PacketCrypt Pool Code \u00b6 The code and documentation for running a pool is available on the C / nodejs version of the PacketCrypt project, the new Rust version only contains Announcement Miner and Announcement Handlers. Announcement Difficulty \u00b6 PacketCrypt is designed in such a way that a mining pool can double its effective power by: Doubling the total block mining computation effort Doubling the total announcement mining computation effort, or Doubling the amount of bandwidth between announcement miners and the pool The way that a pool operator limits the amount of bandwidth flowing into the pool, to prevent overloading of the network, is by setting what is known as the announcement difficulty . The announcement difficulty for a pool specifies how much work must be done on an announcement in order for the announcement to be accepted and paid out by the pool. Announcement difficulty serves to slow down the announcement miners to protect the pool's network. In general, doubling the announcement difficulty will halve the amount of bandwidth used by the pool and will also halve the pool's overall mining power, with a limit that setting the announcement difficulty lower than 2 does not bring any additional value. To explain why it works like this, we need to examine the PacketCrypt algorithm rules and the in particular how the block mining software decides which announcements to use when attempting to mine a block. Announcement Set Selection \u00b6 PacketCrypt algorithm allows block miners to perform less work if they are able to prove that they had a certain number of \"high value\" announcements in memory at the time of mining, the exact ratio of actual work a block miner must do to the amount of work the PKT blockchain requires is called the power multipler . For a block miner seeking to optimize their power multiplier, every announcement has a particular level of utility value which is based on the amount of work that was done by the announcement miner (announcement difficulty) and how old the announcement is. We call this the effective difficulty . The effective difficulty of an announcement starts off as the actual difficulty of the work done to mine it and then decreases by half every block-period until it is less than 1 and the announcement is no longer usable for mining. The block mining software selects a subset of announcements which which will give it the best power multiplier based on the PacketCrypt algorithm: power_multiplier = min(effective_difficulty) * ann_count ** 2 The min(effective_difficulty) is the effective difficulty of the \"least valuable\" announcement that is being mined with. Lets assume that announcement miners are providing a steady supply of 1000 announcements per block-period and all announcements have an initial announcement difficulty of 128. The block mining software can choose to mine with 1000 announcements at 128 effective difficulty, or with 2000 announcements at 64 effective difficulty, or with 3000 announcements at 32 effective difficulty and so on. The best choice is to use the previous three block periods which provides a power multiplier that is 225% higher than that of using just the most recent 1 period worth of announcements. This curve is the same no matter what difficulty we are starting with. Optimal Difficulty Curve \u00b6 Knowing that the optimal announcement set is all of those announcements mined over the past 3 block periods, we can compute the overall power of a pool as the announcement difficulty is raised. At announcement difficulty 1, announcements cannot be used for more than 1 block, but if we imagine that the announcement mining community can produce 1000 announcements per block at difficulty 1 then we can reason that the power multiplier will be 1000 ** 2 or 1 million. At difficulty 2 we can expect the announcement miners will produce 500 announcements per block period but since 2 block periods can be used, the power multiplier is the same. At difficulty 4, the announcement miners will produce 250 announcements per block period and they will be valid for 3 block periods making the power multiplier 750 ** 2 or 562,500. From here, the power output of the power multiplier of the optimal announcement set halves for each doubling of the announcement difficulty, making the optimal difficulty 2 . FAQ for ANN Miners \u00b6 What does overflow mean? \u00b6 When the ann handler receives an announcement, it puts it into a queue, when the queue fills up it responds overflow immediately. The queue can become long, so you may receive \"operation timed out\" you're still being paid, when you receive \"overflow\" you are not being paid. Unfortunately, you may also receive \"operation timed out\" because the handler is unresponsive, it's not obvious which is the reason from looking at the logs. For example, what you will see in the AnnMiner Logs: 1618394538 INFO annmine.rs:519 467 Ke/s 28.56Mb/s overflow: [0, 0, 3072, 0] uploading: [0, 0, 17632, 0] accept/reject: [26932/0, 0/0, 4856/0, 796/0] - goodrate: [100%, 100%, 61%, 100%] 467 Ke/s 467 kilo-encryptions (thousands of encryptions) per second of mining power. 28.56Mb/s Total upload bandwidth (to all pools - combined) overflow: [0, 0, 3072, 0] Overflowed the internal queue of the ann miner, before it was even able to upload to the pool, one number for each pool you're mining to. 3072 Number of anns which are not uploaded to pool #3. uploading [0, 0, 17632, 0] Number of anns currently in-flight in active http requests, again 3rd pool is a problem, others are doing well (in this example). accept/reject [26932/0, 0/0, 4856/0, 796/0] Anns accepted/rejected by each pool, these numbers are based on the previous 10 seconds, pool #2 is giving a zero accepted which might be an issue, keep watching the next message 10 seconds later for another update. goodrate [100%, 100%, 61%, 100%] Goodrate = number of anns accepted divided by number of anns produced.","title":"How to Start Announcement Mining"},{"location":"start_mining/announcement-mining/#how-to-start-announcement-mining","text":"Announcement Mining creates a small (1KB) message that is difficult to compress and proves work was done.

In order to mine PKT you must first set up a PKT Wallet. You must use a PKT wallet that is compatible with mining. A mining wallet is required because PKT miners get paid every 60 seconds. As a result of getting paid 1,440 times per day (60 minutes per hour * 24 hours per day) each PKT wallet must have the ability to scale in order to support the amount of mining transactions. Learn how to set up a PKT Wallet [here]. Miners who are working in collaboration with one another are members of a mining pool, therefore all mining of PacketCrypt is done in pools. Mining PKT utilizes 2 distinct stages: announcement mining and block mining. Announcement Mining - Using your CPU to create Announcements Announcement Mining creates a small (1KB) message that is difficult to compress and proves work was done. Announcements are transmitted to and collected by block miners to form blocks. This simulates the transmission of data across the network. Announcement miners must maximize their CPU processing power and bandwidth upload speed for the highest yields. Announcement mining can be done from nearly any device that has a CPU processor and access to bandwidth. To learn more about announcement mining, click [here]. Block Mining - Collecting Announcements from Announcement Miners and using them to mine blocks. Block mining involves setting up a mining pool. PKT mining pools require expert networking experience, significant hardware and bandwidth infrastructure with a minimum of 25 gbps of bandwidth ingest. Block miners gain efficiency on the difficulty of the work, based on the amount of new announcements they have in memory at the time of mining. This incentivizes mining pools to pay announcement miners to supply announcements. Block mining is typically done at the mining pool's datacenter.","title":"Intro to PKT Mining"},{"location":"start_mining/intro/#intro-to-pkt-mining","text":"DPKT is mined using the novel PacketCrypt bandwidth-hard mining algorithm which requires bandwidth to mine.

Mining \u00b6 PacketCrypt is a bandwidth hard proof of work , this means it requires lots of bandwidth to mine. Miners collaborate with one another by sending small messages (called Announcements ) and the sending of these messages requires a large amount of bandwidth . Miners who are working in collaboration with one another are members of a mining pool, therefore all mining of PacketCrypt is done in pools. PacketCrypt mining is split into two distinct stages: Announcement Mining - Using your CPU to create Announcements Block Mining - Collecting Announcements from Announcement Miners and using them to mine blocks Block mining is typically done at the mining pool's datacenter, however Announcement mining can be done from anywhere. How to Announcement mine \u00b6 There are a number of options available when it comes to installing the PacketCrpyt announcement miner. Choose whichever best suits your technical ability: 1. Install a Pre-built Binary \u00b6 Pre-built packetcrypt binaries (for linux) or installation packages (for macos) and archives (for windows) can be downloaded from packetcrypt releases page . For windows , download the zip archive suffixed with -windows.zip and extract its content. For macos , download the package suffixed with .pkg and click on its icon in the Finder for installation. For linux , download the binary suffixed with -linux_amd64 and rename it packetcrypt . If you're on Arch linux or Manjaro, you can install the packetcrypt AUR package 2. Deploy a Docker Image \u00b6 There is a PacketCrypt Docker image available, which can be used for announcement mining. To install: Download and install Docker for your operating system. Download the PacketCrypt Docker image: $ docker pull thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt There are also PacketCrypt Docker images built without the portable flag ( --no-portable ) which may increase the performance of the announcement mining while reducing CPU compatibility. One such image (compiled on AMD 5950x) is available at thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt-amd64 . Additionally, for ARM devices such as Raspberry Pi, there is an image available at thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt-arm64 . The arm64 image will also work on Apple silicon such as the M1 and M2 chips. Run the container similar to the commands described in the Begin Announcement Mining section, except replace this part of the command: $ packetcrypt with this command to run PacketCrypt from Docker: $ docker run thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt The final command will be formatted like this: $ docker run thomasjp0x42/packetcrypt ann -p <your_wallet_address> <pool_1> More information can be found at the PacketCrypt DockerHub page 3. Build From Source \u00b6 Building from source will generally offer the best mining performance but requires more technical knowledge than the previous two options. First install rust if you haven't, see: rustup git clone https://github.com/cjdelisle/packetcrypt_rs cd packetcrypt_rs cargo build --release See the PacketCrypt GitHub repository for more detailed instructions. Begin Announcement Mining \u00b6 Important You cannot mine into the electrum wallet , You can only mine into the Command Line Wallet , the Pkt.World Wallet or the Mac GUI Wallet . To begin mining, you will need the address of your wallet and you will need to choose a pool. There are two ways to configure the announcement miner; by using CLI parameters or by using a configuration file: Using the CLI packetcrypt ann -p <your_wallet_address> pool_1 [pool_2 pool_3 pool_4] [or for windows] packetcrypt.exe ann -p <your_wallet_address> pool_1 [pool_2 pool_3 pool_4] Using a Configuration File A configuration file must be in JSON format. The file can be loaded from the local filesystem or from a web-accessible location. Any CLI parameters used will overide the corresponding settings in the configuration file. Example config.json: { \"payment_addr\": \"<your_wallet_address>\", \"pools\": [ \"pool_1\", \"pool_2\", \"pool_3\", \"pool_4\" ] } packetcrypt ann -c \"./config.json\" [or] packetcrypt ann -c \"https://example.com/config.json\" [or for windows] packetcrypt.exe ann -c \"./config.json\" [or] packetcrypt.exe ann -c \"https://example.com/config.json\" Announcement mining can be done into a single pool or multiple pools. When you announcement mine into multiple pools, you will be paid by each pool that you submit announcements to. pool_1 is the pool running the highest difficulty. If you notice problems, you can test listing the pools in a different order. The number of pools you mine into is at your discretion. If a pool is down or malfunctioning you will notice the pool is not mining at [100%] in your mining feed and you can choose to remove the under-performing or malfunctioning pool. How to install a PKT miner on Mac \u00b6 Install the Zulu or CLI PKT Wallet from https://docs.pkt.cash Download the PacketCrypt.pkg for mac Open your Terminal Install Rust by entering in the command: $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf * https://sh.rustup.rs | sh Press 1 to confirm Enter the command: $ sudo install make Enter the command: $ git clone https://github.com/cjdelisle/packetcrypt_rs Enter the command: $ cd packetcrypt_rs Enter the command: $ ~/.cargo/bin/cargo build --release Enter the command: $ ./target/release/packetcrypt ann -p [your PKT Wallet Address] [pool 1] [pool 2] [pool 3] [pool 4] Choosing Pools to mine in \u00b6 You can mine in as many pools as you have the bandwidth to supply. The same data will be uploaded so your CPU is only used once. Currently the pools which are regularly winning blocks include: Pkteer: http://pool.pkteer.com PKTPool: http://pool.pktpool.io PktWorld: http://pool.pkt.world Zetahash (f.k.a. Srizbi): https://stratum.zetahash.com In general the recommendation is to list the pool with highest difficulty in the first position to ensure your announcements will be accepted, as the standardized policy is to accept announcements of a higher difficulty for pools with a lower base difficulty. In some cases the rewards might vary depending on the pool order regardless of difficulty, subject to custom policies implemented by the respective pools. (Check the relevant channels on Discord for current pool statuses) You should test your daily earnings on each pool to see which one is best. Your mining revenue depends on how much each pool allocates towards announcement miners as well as how much hardware they are using in-house. The pools are winning different blocks and if you mine to just one pool, your not getting any payment from the others when they win a block. It's the same with mining to a pool that is not winning any blocks. Limiting System Resource Usage \u00b6 Limiting the system resources available to Packetcrypt may negatively effect your mining power but can be useful to conserve resources for other processess. Limit CPU Usage \u00b6 Announcement mining is a resource intensive process. By default, Packetcrypt will use 100% of the available CPU resources. CPU usage can be limited by assigning a limited number of threads to packetcrypt using the -t CLI parameter or \"threads\" key if using a configuration file. Example of assigning four (4) threads to Packetcrypt: packetcrypt ann -p <your_wallet_address> pool_1 [pool_2 pool_3 pool_4] -t 4 or { \"threads\" 4 } Limit Bandwidth Usage \u00b6 Bandwidth usage is directly related to two main factors: 1 - Mining difficulty of the primary pool (the first pool listed in Packetcrypt pool configuration) A lower difficulty means higher bandwidth usage 2 - The number of pools mined Packetcrypt will send the same Announcements to each pool mined Bandwidth usage can therefore be limited by selecting a higher difficulty pool as the primary pool and/or by mining to fewer pools. Block Mining & Running a Pool \u00b6 Because each block miner must use as much bandwidth as all of the announcement miners combined , block mining is typically done at the location of the pool. Even a pool operator who wanted to support external block mining would find that the pool itself would need enough upload bandwidth to match all of the block miners - which would be completely untenable. If you are interested in block mining, contact the pool operator and discuss sending hardware to their location. Starting your own pool requires setting up a number of services: pktd node (one or more) - One pktd instance is required for the Master to function, each of the Block Handlers may optionally use separate pktd nodes. Master (one) - This node coordinates all of the others and provides work files and configuration Ann Handler (one or more) - These are high performance nodes which accept announcements from the announcement miners in the network, they also provide announcements to the block miners. As you scale up the amount of bandwidth in the pool, you will need to add more Ann handlers. Block Miner (one or more) - These nodes download announcements from the announcement handlers and use them in the mining process to mine blocks. Block Handlers (one or more) - These nodes receive \"block shares\" from the block miners and submit blocks if Paymaker (1) - This node receives updates from the Ann Handlers and Block Handlers and keeps track of who should be paid. The Paymaker sends configuration to the pktd node which is used by the Master in order to make the pool pay out the announcement and block miners PacketCrypt Data Flow \u00b6 \u2588 Orange: Announcements are sent from the Announcement miners to the Ann Handlers and then to the Block miners \u2588 Blue: Block shares are sent from block miners to Block Handler(s) \u2588 Purple: Winning blocks are submitted by the Block Handler(s) to pktd and the PKT network \u2588 Pink: Block Handlers and Ann Handlers inform Paymaker of work done by announcement and block miners \u2588 Green: Paymaker configures pktd instance to create blocks which pay the people who have been mining \u2588 Brown: Master gets block templates from pktd instance Black dotted line: All nodes request configuration and block templates from Master node More Information and PacketCrypt Pool Code \u00b6 The code and documentation for running a pool is available on the C / nodejs version of the PacketCrypt project, the new Rust version only contains Announcement Miner and Announcement Handlers. Announcement Difficulty \u00b6 PacketCrypt is designed in such a way that a mining pool can double its effective power by: Doubling the total block mining computation effort Doubling the total announcement mining computation effort, or Doubling the amount of bandwidth between announcement miners and the pool The way that a pool operator limits the amount of bandwidth flowing into the pool, to prevent overloading of the network, is by setting what is known as the announcement difficulty . The announcement difficulty for a pool specifies how much work must be done on an announcement in order for the announcement to be accepted and paid out by the pool. Announcement difficulty serves to slow down the announcement miners to protect the pool's network. In general, doubling the announcement difficulty will halve the amount of bandwidth used by the pool and will also halve the pool's overall mining power, with a limit that setting the announcement difficulty lower than 2 does not bring any additional value. To explain why it works like this, we need to examine the PacketCrypt algorithm rules and the in particular how the block mining software decides which announcements to use when attempting to mine a block. Announcement Set Selection \u00b6 PacketCrypt algorithm allows block miners to perform less work if they are able to prove that they had a certain number of \"high value\" announcements in memory at the time of mining, the exact ratio of actual work a block miner must do to the amount of work the PKT blockchain requires is called the power multipler . For a block miner seeking to optimize their power multiplier, every announcement has a particular level of utility value which is based on the amount of work that was done by the announcement miner (announcement difficulty) and how old the announcement is. We call this the effective difficulty . The effective difficulty of an announcement starts off as the actual difficulty of the work done to mine it and then decreases by half every block-period until it is less than 1 and the announcement is no longer usable for mining. The block mining software selects a subset of announcements which which will give it the best power multiplier based on the PacketCrypt algorithm: power_multiplier = min(effective_difficulty) * ann_count ** 2 The min(effective_difficulty) is the effective difficulty of the \"least valuable\" announcement that is being mined with. Lets assume that announcement miners are providing a steady supply of 1000 announcements per block-period and all announcements have an initial announcement difficulty of 128. The block mining software can choose to mine with 1000 announcements at 128 effective difficulty, or with 2000 announcements at 64 effective difficulty, or with 3000 announcements at 32 effective difficulty and so on. The best choice is to use the previous three block periods which provides a power multiplier that is 225% higher than that of using just the most recent 1 period worth of announcements. This curve is the same no matter what difficulty we are starting with. Optimal Difficulty Curve \u00b6 Knowing that the optimal announcement set is all of those announcements mined over the past 3 block periods, we can compute the overall power of a pool as the announcement difficulty is raised. At announcement difficulty 1, announcements cannot be used for more than 1 block, but if we imagine that the announcement mining community can produce 1000 announcements per block at difficulty 1 then we can reason that the power multiplier will be 1000 ** 2 or 1 million. At difficulty 2 we can expect the announcement miners will produce 500 announcements per block period but since 2 block periods can be used, the power multiplier is the same. At difficulty 4, the announcement miners will produce 250 announcements per block period and they will be valid for 3 block periods making the power multiplier 750 ** 2 or 562,500. From here, the power output of the power multiplier of the optimal announcement set halves for each doubling of the announcement difficulty, making the optimal difficulty 2 . FAQ for ANN Miners \u00b6 What does overflow mean? \u00b6 When the ann handler receives an announcement, it puts it into a queue, when the queue fills up it responds overflow immediately. The queue can become long, so you may receive \"operation timed out\" you're still being paid, when you receive \"overflow\" you are not being paid. Unfortunately, you may also receive \"operation timed out\" because the handler is unresponsive, it's not obvious which is the reason from looking at the logs. For example, what you will see in the AnnMiner Logs: 1618394538 INFO annmine.rs:519 467 Ke/s 28.56Mb/s overflow: [0, 0, 3072, 0] uploading: [0, 0, 17632, 0] accept/reject: [26932/0, 0/0, 4856/0, 796/0] - goodrate: [100%, 100%, 61%, 100%] 467 Ke/s 467 kilo-encryptions (thousands of encryptions) per second of mining power. 28.56Mb/s Total upload bandwidth (to all pools - combined) overflow: [0, 0, 3072, 0] Overflowed the internal queue of the ann miner, before it was even able to upload to the pool, one number for each pool you're mining to. 3072 Number of anns which are not uploaded to pool #3. uploading [0, 0, 17632, 0] Number of anns currently in-flight in active http requests, again 3rd pool is a problem, others are doing well (in this example). accept/reject [26932/0, 0/0, 4856/0, 796/0] Anns accepted/rejected by each pool, these numbers are based on the previous 10 seconds, pool #2 is giving a zero accepted which might be an issue, keep watching the next message 10 seconds later for another update. goodrate [100%, 100%, 61%, 100%] Goodrate = number of anns accepted divided by number of anns produced. Setting up a Pool \u00b6 Expectations \u00b6 General knowledge of Linux General knowledge of git General knowledge of networking General knowledge of blockchain Access to at least 6 machines running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or 20.04 LTS , to deploy the following services. Machine 1 : PKT node Machine 2 : Master, Paymaker & Blkhander Machine 3 : AnnHandler Machine 4 : AnnHandler Machine 5 : BlkMiner Machine 6 : BlkMiner Note: It can be done all on a single machine, you just need to pay attention to ports etc. As of June 2022, the network difficulty is high, and given that half of the work is done at pool premises, it's recommended to run at least a dozen BlkMiner machines, with a significant (768GB recommended) ammount of RAM. Block mining & running a pool \u00b6 Starting your own pool requires setting up a number of services: pktd node (one or more) - One pktd instance is required for the Master to function, each of the Block Handlers may optionally use separate pktd nodes. Master (one) - This node coordinates all of the others and provides work files and configuration Ann Handler (two or more) - These are nodes which accept announcements from the announcement miners in the network, they also provide announcements to the block miners. As you scale up the amount of bandwidth in the pool, you will need to add more Ann handlers. Block Miner (two or more) - These high performance nodes download announcements from the announcement handlers and use them in the mining process to mine blocks. Block Handlers (one or more) - These nodes receive \"block shares\" from the block miners and submit blocks if they validate the share Paymaker (one) - This node receives updates from the Ann Handlers and Block Handlers and keeps track of who should be paid. The Paymaker sends configuration to the pktd node which is used by the Master in order to make the pool pay out the announcement and block miners General Information \u00b6 Repository Information: \u00b6 The following repositories hold the required programs to run a pool: Repository Tools packetcrypt_rs: https://github.com/cjdelisle/packetcrypt_rs AnnHandler, Blkminer, AnnMiner PacketCrypt: https://github.com/cjdelisle/PacketCrypt/ Master, Paymaker, BlkHandler pktd: https://github.com/pkt-cash/pktd pktd Assumed network Ranges: \u00b6 In this guide we have two separate networks, the public network (198.51.100.0/24), and local network (10.0.16.0/24) to connect AnnHandlers and BlkMiner.

Setting this value to an alphanumeric value e.g oHk8TXpbtRRZGtaYYMnIFAzYMrVh6vA8XzKWWXcKbzCThuFLIJ234bHN5peddQFzR2TtQyo58gcFRP7bKg9BeXZirSqp9gVpjBWp In general, this value should be set to the null, as signing announcements is rarely used, and breaks Announcement mining with multiple pools if you have your pool externally accessable, and should only be set if you have a strong understanding and knowledge of what you are doing. config.privateSeed = null If you aren't bothered by, or don't require your announcements to be signed . config.paymakerHttpPasswd \u00b6 Anyone who has this password can make http posts to the paymaker (claim that shares were won) You should make this random and also firewall the paymaker from the public. The upload will be done using Authorization Basic with a username of \"x\" and this as the password config.paymakerHttpPasswd = 'anyone with this password can post results to the paymaker'; You can put the paymaker behind an http proxy if you wish. config.masterUrl \u00b6 This is used by the paymaker and block handler when running them with pool.js, it is used to resolve where the master is. You can either set this as a locally host or put your master behind a nginx proxy config.masterUrl = 'http://localhost:8080'; or if you have your instance public, and you want to have it be resolvable publically, replace the url with your own. config.masterUrl = 'http://pool.pktpool.io'; config.rpc \u00b6 The username and password set here, should be the same username and password used at the end of this guide for when you configure the pktd service. user: 'x', pass: 'x', config.annHandlers \u00b6 Information: config.annHandlers is a list of json object, with an object for each individual annhandler you would like to run, each ann handler will require it's own individual port. As the AnnHandler will be run on the same machine as the BlkMiner you need to make sure there are no over-lapping port bindings. If you plan to allow external AnnMiners (AnnMiners not on your LAN to mine against your pool, the url's placed in the AnnHandlers list, should be externally resolvable. The address that is advertized for accessing this ann handler (external address) If running locally use: url: 'http://10.0.16.3:8081','http://10.0.16.4:8081' If allowing external annminers use a resolved address such as: url: 'http://ann1.pktpool.io','http://ann2.pktpool.io' Replace the url with your own. config.blkHandlers \u00b6 Information: config.blkHandlers is a list of json object, with an object for each individual annhandler you would like to run, each ann handler will require it's own individual port. BlockHandlers are low-effort high-volume single-threaded workers. What address should be advertized for accessing this BlkHander, again make sure there are no overlapping ports. If you are wanting to support external blockminers, this address should be externally resolvable url: 'http://localhost:8100', This is the port that the blkHandler will bind to. port: 8082, This is the host that the blkHandler will bind to. host: '::', This is how many requests a blkHandler can queue before the handler starts rejecting requests maxConnections: 50, root: config config.master \u00b6 Which port to run the master on port: 8080, What address to bind to, set to localhost if proxying host: '::', Minimum work for an announcement. This number is effectively a bandwidth divisor, every time you double this number you will reduce your bandwidth by a factor of two. annMinWork: Util.annWorkToTarget(128), Average number of shares per block, reducing this number will reduce load on your block handlers, but increasing it will allow payment to be spread more evenly between block miners. This wants to be set to a higher number than one, for the purpose of constantly testing that the block miners are making valid shares. You may have a block miner sitting for hours without a share and then when it wins one, it can become invalid because of misconfiguration shareWorkDivisor: 4, Which versions of announcements we will accept annVersions: [1], Request that ann miners mine announcements that are this many blocks old. Announcements contain a commitment of the most recent block hash but they need 3 blocks to \"mature\" before they can be used The point of this is so that PacketCrypt is about bandwidth, not latency. But there is a risk: If there is a surge then you are going to be starved for announcements When you are starved, you will have few usable anns which causes a slow-down in mining and the announcements which are being submitted are not usable. When you win a few blocks, those announcements become usable and you surge, which causes you to go back into starvation again. This should be set to either: 0 Which means the announcements you are receiving are used instantly 3 Which means you are waiting for the announcements to mature before using them.

The announcement difficulty for a pool specifies how much work must be done on an announcement in order for the announcement to be accepted and paid out by the pool. Announcement difficulty serves to slow down the announcement miners to protect the pool's network. In general, doubling the announcement difficulty will halve the amount of bandwidth used by the pool and will also halve the pool's overall mining power, with a limit that setting the announcement difficulty lower than 2 does not bring any additional value.

For a block miner seeking to optimize their power multiplier, every announcement has a particular level of utility value which is based on the amount of work that was done by the announcement miner (announcement difficulty) and how old the announcement is. We call this the effective difficulty . The effective difficulty of an announcement starts off as the actual difficulty of the work done to mine it and then decreases by half every block-period until it is less than 1 and the announcement is no longer usable for mining. The block mining software selects a subset of announcements which which will give it the best power multiplier based on the PacketCrypt algorithm: power_multiplier = min(effective_difficulty) * ann_count ** 2 The min(effective_difficulty) is the effective difficulty of the \"least valuable\" announcement that is being mined with. Lets assume that announcement miners are providing a steady supply of 1000 announcements per block-period and all announcements have an initial announcement difficulty of 128. The block mining software can choose to mine with 1000 announcements at 128 effective difficulty, or with 2000 announcements at 64 effective difficulty, or with 3000 announcements at 32 effective difficulty and so on. The best choice is to use the previous three block periods which provides a power multiplier that is 225% higher than that of using just the most recent 1 period worth of announcements.

At difficulty 2 we can expect the announcement miners will produce 500 announcements per block period but since 2 block periods can be used, the power multiplier is the same. At difficulty 4, the announcement miners will produce 250 announcements per block period and they will be valid for 3 block periods making the power multiplier 750 ** 2 or 562,500.

The first time PKT Electrum is opened, you will get a popup asking you if you want to open it, click open Continue with Setting up your wallet below Windows \u00b6 Download the file ending with .exe from the latest PKT Electrum Releases You will see a popup window telling you the application is not signed by a Microsoft Authorized Developer, always be sure you download PKT Electrum from the original website, do not run any app given to you in a chat, file-sharing or email attachment. Click \"More info\" to show additional options. Click the \"Run anyway\" button to launch PKT Electrum, you won't see this message again. Follow the steps in the setup process. Go to your desktop and you should see a new icon labeled PKT Electrum , click on it. Continue with Setting up your wallet below. Linux \u00b6 Download the file ending with .AppImage from the latest PKT Electrum Releases Click on the downloaded file and PKT Electrum should start up right away. Setting up your wallet \u00b6 Before you can begin using PKT, you need to setup your wallet, this means writing down your secret key and setting passwords so your PKT will stay safe. First you will be asked if you want to configure the server to connect to, unless you are an advanced user, just click \"next\" Next select your wallet, you give your wallet a name if you wish, or leave it as default_wallet , then click \"next\". You will be prompted to select which type of wallet you are creating, unless you are doing something fancy, you'll want to just click \"next\" Next you will have the option to create a wallet using a secret key from different sources, for the purposes of this tutorial just click next. Next you will be asked if you want to create a \"legacy\" style wallet, this is not needed so just click \"next\" Now PKT Electrum is going to create a seed , it takes the form of 12 words and from it your entire wallet is created If you have these 12 special words, you can recover your PKT even if your computer is lost or damaged If someone else gets access to these 12 words, they can steal all of your PKT It is recommended that you write this on paper and keep in a safe place. After you have written your seed, you will be asked to type it back in, the fast way to do this is by copy/paste to a text pad Now you'll be asked to write it back in, you can copy it from the text pad Make sure you really stored your seed on paper, we do not recommend storing it on any electronic device . Now you will need to pick a passphrase for your wallet This passphrase encrypts your wallet, protecting your PKT even if your computer is stolen Unlike your seed, the passphrase is useless without the wallet file We recommend using https://www.useapassphrase.com/ to pick a strong passphrase for you You can store your passphrase on your phone to have easy access Congratulations, you now have a PKT wallet! It will require about 5 minutes to synchronize with the PKT blockchain, but you can still use it while this is happening. Receiving PKT \u00b6 To receive coins, you need to create a new PKT address Click the \"Receive\" tab Type a description for the purpose of receiving the coins, this will appear in the notification when you get paid Set the expiration, if this is not an invoice , you can choose \"never\" After you click \"Request\", your wallet will create a new address and copy it to your clipboard so you can send it to the person paying you (or transfer money to your new wallet) When PKT gets sent to your new address, you will get a notification. It says \"unconfirmed\" because the transaction has not yet been included in the history of the blockchain. Once your transaction has been included in the blockchain, this icon will change to a clock and then after a few minutes, a checkmark Congratulations, you have received your first PKT Sending PKT \u00b6 To pay PKT to someone else, click on the Send tab and paste the address to be paid Type a description of the payment, this is just for you, it will not be sent to the person you are paying Enter the amount to be paid Click Pay You will be prompted to enter your wallet passphrase in order to decrypt the wallet for one brief moment to send the PKT Every transaction requires a fee for inclusion in the blockchain, this is a very small cost: 132 nPKT is one hundred and thirty two nano-PKT (that means billionths , i.e. 0.000000132 PKT) After you enter your passphrase and click \"send\", you will see a transaction ID , this set of numbers and letters uniquely identifies your transaction and can be used to view it in the block explorer. Just like when receiving, your transaction will appear first as \"unconfirmed\" and then later it will switch to a clock when it has been included in the blockchain. After waiting a few minutes, you will see a clock and then later a checkmark indicating your transaction has been included in the blockchain When people consider a transaction to be \"complete\" depends on the merchant, but in general it should be considered to be ok once it switches from \"unconfirmed\" to the clock icon. Congratulations, you've sent PKT! About Units \u00b6 Each PKT is made up of 1000 milli-PKT, denoted mPKT Each milli-PKT is sub-divided into 1000 micro-PKT, denoted uPKT Each micro-PKT is sub-divided into 1000 nano-PKT, denoted nPKT Advanced usage \u00b6 Recover from seed \u00b6 You can recover a PKT Electrum wallet from the seed you were given when you set it up. To do this follow the same instructions as for any other Electrum wallet: https://bitcoinelectrum.com/restoring-your-standard-wallet-from-seed/ Note that recovery from seed will not work to import addresses from other wallets such as a Gridnode. Multi-signature \u00b6 Setting up multi-signature in PKT Electrum is the same as with Bitcoin Electrum so you can follow this tutorial: https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multisig.html How it works \u00b6 PKT Electrum is significantly similar to Bitcoin Electrum. It contacts one of a pool of community operated electrumx servers. Instead of syncing the entire chain it requests information about its addresses from the electrumx server and only downloads enough of the blockchain to verify that the electrumx server is not trying to trick it. In practice this means the wallet needs to check the proof of work and sync the block headers but not the rest of the blocks. Since PKT uses PacketCrypt proof of work, the work verification needs to be different. PacketCrypt headers are fairly large, between 4KB and 16KB, even at only 4KB each they make up 2.1GB of data per year. To maintain security without downloading an unacceptably large amount of data, PKT Electrum downloads only a small number of PacketCrypt proofs near the tip of the chain. If the wallet only downloaded (say) the most recent 100 PacketCrypt proofs, an attacking electrumx server would know exactly how many blocks it needed to mine in order to create a convincing fake chain, PKT Electrum makes this more difficult by using statistical verification. Statistical Verification \u00b6 PKT Electrum makes the job of an attacker hard by asking for an unpredictable random set of PacketCrypt proofs, the chance of any give block being verified is based on the distance between the tip of the chain and that block. The chance is defined as MIN(100%, K / distance_from_tip) where K is a constant which we set at 20 to make PKT Electrum verify around 200 blocks total. With K = 20 , the first 20 blocks have a 100% chance of being verified. * block 21 has a 95% chance * block 25 has an 80% chance * block 50 has a 40% chance * block 80 has a 25% chance The distribution of likelyhood of verifying a block is shown by this chart: Running an ElectrumX server \u00b6 If you would like to participate in running your own ElectrumX server to help the PKT Electrum network, you can do so using a simple Docker command. Check out the Docker PKT Electrumx project for more information about how to run an instance. It is important to keep your seed and password written down in a safe place where you will remember it. If your PKT Electrum wallet is mined into, it will break. You will then need to migrate your PKT Electrum wallet to a PKT CLI wallet using the following instructions. Migrating from Electrum to PKTWallet \u00b6 If you have an electrum based wallet which becomes overloaded from too many transactions (e.g. from mining directly into it), then you will need to migrate your keys to a pktwallet instance. Step 1: Setup pktwallet \u00b6 Follow the instructions in pktwallet to get your wallet up and running Step 2: Export your keys \u00b6 In Electrum, click Wallet -> Private Keys -> Export You will be prompted to enter your Electrum wallet password, then a window should appear showing your keys KEEP THESE KEYS SECRET Find an address which you want to migrate and copy the key with that address Do not copy the part which says p2wpkh: , just the letters after it The key will look sometihng like this: ci2TBp2HTWtyMQtizWMuugHxG6lNpInA1bSpLIWzjJS2AI8ObwV5 Step 3: Import key to pktwallet \u00b6 In a terminal window, run pktctl --wallet getbalance to verify that your wallet is working Unlock your wallet using pktctl --wallet walletpassphrase <the password you used when setting it up> 1000000 Type pktctl --wallet importprivkey <the key you just copied> You should see the address printed on the screen Importing more keys \u00b6 When you import a key, it starts a rescan of the chain automatically, in order to import more you need to stop pktctl --wallet stopresync to stop Speed things up \u00b6 If you know exactly when an address was paid, you can speed up the import by only rescanning blocks where it might have been paid. For example if you are sure that the address was not paid earlier than block number 600000 you can do the following: pktctl --wallet stopresync pktctl --wallet resync 600000 100000000 Check that it's working \u00b6 It's recommended that you run pktwallet with -d debug flag in order to be able to see the debug logs. When you are resyncing you should see log lines like the following: 1609188780 [DBG] wallet.go:2817 Rescan cycle [620100] 1609188781 [DBG] wallet.go:2817 Rescan cycle [620200] 1609188782 [DBG] wallet.go:2817 Rescan cycle [620300] 1609188783 [DBG] wallet.go:2817 Rescan cycle [620400] The number if the block number which is being scanned.

It contacts one of a pool of community operated electrumx servers. Instead of syncing the entire chain it requests information about its addresses from the electrumx server and only downloads enough of the blockchain to verify that the electrumx server is not trying to trick it. In practice this means the wallet needs to check the proof of work and sync the block headers but not the rest of the blocks. Since PKT uses PacketCrypt proof of work, the work verification needs to be different. PacketCrypt headers are fairly large, between 4KB and 16KB, even at only 4KB each they make up 2.1GB of data per year. To maintain security without downloading an unacceptably large amount of data, PKT Electrum downloads only a small number of PacketCrypt proofs near the tip of the chain. If the wallet only downloaded (say) the most recent 100 PacketCrypt proofs, an attacking electrumx server would know exactly how many blocks it needed to mine in order to create a convincing fake chain, PKT Electrum makes this more difficult by using statistical verification.","title":"How it works"},{"location":"wallet_setup/install-pkt-electrum/#statistical-verification","text":"PKT Electrum makes the job of an attacker hard by asking for an unpredictable random set of PacketCrypt proofs, the chance of any give block being verified is based on the distance between the tip of the chain and that block.

This is your newly created PKT address which you can use for receiving coins. If you need to view it after creation, the address, along with the balance, can be seen in the output from running: ./bin/pktctl --wallet getaddressbalances 1 1 NOTE : Every time you use getnewaddress , the address you receive must be remembered by pktwallet forever.

Some functions will be limited until pktwallet is fully synchronized. Some functions require the wallet being unlocked before executing. Getting Your Balance \u00b6 You can check your current PKT balance using pktctl or you can check the balances of each of your addresses if you have more than one. ./bin/pktctl --wallet getbalance or: ./bin/pktctl --wallet getaddressbalances getaddressbalances by itself will not show 0 balance addresses you may have created. To show these addresses, use: ./bin/pktctl --wallet getaddressbalances 1 1 For more explanation of the meaning of the output of getaddressbalances , use: ./bin/pktctl --wallet help getaddressbalances Unlocking Wallet \u00b6 While many functions can be performed while the wallet is locked, other functions first require the wallet to be unlocked, including sending PKT and folding. The passphrase used to unlock the wallet was set when creating the wallet. To unlock your wallet for 120 seconds (this can be changed to your liking), use: ./bin/pktctl --wallet walletpassphrase <passphrase you used when creating wallet> 120 To keep your wallet unlocked, use: ./bin/pktctl --wallet walletpassphrase <passphrase you used when creating wallet> 0 If using 0 as in the previous example to keep your wallet indefinitely unlocked, it will stay unlocked until you either restart pktwallet or run: ./bin/pktctl --wallet walletlock NOTE: Special characters (e.g., !, #, & *) in your passphrase may be incorrectly interpreted by your shell. You may need to wrap your passphrase in quotes. ./bin/pktctl --wallet walletpassphrase 'suP3r_S3cReT^P@s5W0Rd!' 120 Sending PKT \u00b6 You can send PKT using the sendtoaddress command, but first you must unlock your wallet for sending, as shown in the previous step. To send cjd a 10 PKT tip: ./bin/pktctl --wallet sendtoaddress pkt1qt8xe7dwpelngtcpsgn5nkj3pwwdm7gf3l4auax 10 Sending PKT from Specific Address \u00b6 pktwallet gives you control over which addresses are used for making a payment. This means you can keep different PKT in your wallet separate, for example separating business transactions from personal transactions. NOTE : PKT is not a \"privacy coin\", so transactions are still shown in the blockchain like with Bitcoin. Unlock wallet: ./bin/pktctl --wallet walletpassphrase <passphrase you used when creating wallet> 60 Send 10 PKT to \"their address\" from \"your address\": ./bin/pktctl --wallet sendfrom <their address> 10 '[\"<your address>\"]' Notice the '[\" . This is because the last argument is actually a quoted JSON array . This means you can use multiple addresses as the source of a payment. For example: ./bin/pktctl --wallet sendfrom <their address> 10 '[\"<your address>\", \"<your other address>\"]' Windows users require unique formatting for command prompt: pktctl.exe --wallet sendfrom <their address> 10 [\\\"<your address>\\\"] Sweeping an Address \u00b6 With pktwallet, sending 0 PKT has special significance in that it will send \"as much PKT as possible\". To sweep <old address> address into <new address> , you can use the following command: ./bin/pktctl --wallet sendfrom <new address> 0 '[\"<old address>\"]' Windows: pktctl.exe --wallet sendfrom <new address> 0 [\\\"<old address>\\\"] NOTE : Sweeping an address will send as much PKT as possible , which is not necessarily all PKT in that address. You may need to sweep multiple times before the address is empty. Folding Coins \u00b6 If you are the recipient of many transactions, such as is the case in mining, you may not be able to spend all of them at once. This is similar to someone who is paid in pennies having a difficult time using the pennies to buy a car. To solve this issue, you can consolidate all of the coins which were paid to you by folding . Folding is sweeping an address to itself . Just like in sweeping, you may need to run the command many times before you have completely folded. See FAQs for more detail. For example: ./bin/pktctl --wallet sendfrom <address> 0 '[\"<address>\"]' Windows: pktctl.exe --wallet sendfrom <address> 0 [\\\"<address>\\\"] Alternative GUI Wallets \u00b6 Electrum for PKT (Windows, MacOS, Linux) NOTE: Electrum is not appropriate for mining. Do NOT mine into an electrum wallet! PKT World Wallet (Windows) Zulu Wallet (MacOS) FAQs \u00b6 I have several machines mining, do I need the wallet running on each machine? \u00b6 NO! In fact, the wallet doesn't need to be running at all to mine, but you do need to ensure you have control of the address you are mining to. Should I leave pktwallet running? \u00b6 It is not a requirement to have pktwallet running to mine. However, if you leave it running, it will stay synced. This will save time when performing pktctl functions, such as folding and sending coins. If pktwallet has not been running for some time, it will need time to sync up to the current block from the time it last ran. As a safety precaution, don't forget to lock your wallet if you do keep it running. How often should I fold and why? \u00b6 The purpose of folding is to turn all your small payments (such as from mining) into quickly and easily spendable coins. If you are multi-pool mining and have rewards in every block, you will have roughly 1440 unconsolidated transactions per day - one for each block at a rate of ~ 1 block/min. If you do not fold these transactions, after awhile you'll have a huge amount of transactions to process if you wish to send the sum or portion thereof of these smaller transactions. So, while folding isn't required and will have no impact on mining if you do or do not, you're doing yourself a favor later by keeping the transactions as consolidated as possible. It is typical to fold as much as possible every day or every few days when you think about it, depending on your use case. It can also be scripted. Note that folding is a transaction itself. Depending on how much you have to fold, you may need to run the command many times. You also may need to wait for coins to confirm before folding more. Once the folding command fails or you see a very low number in the outputcount field from running ./bin/pktctl --wallet getaddressbalances 1 1 or on PKT block explorer under Unconsolidated Txns, you have successfully folded the best you can for that point in time.","title":"Installing PKT CLI Wallet (Mac/Windows/Linux)"},{"location":"wallet_setup/pkt-cli-wallet/#installing-pkt-cli-wallet-mac-windows-linux","text":"The command line PKT wallet","title":"Installing PKT CLI Wallet (Mac / Windows / Linux)"},{"location":"wallet_setup/pkt-cli-wallet/#first-time-installation-and-launching","text":"","title":"First Time Installation and Launching"},{"location":"wallet_setup/pkt-cli-wallet/#download-pktd","text":"","title":"Download pktd"},{"location":"wallet_setup/pkt-cli-wallet/#microsoft-windows","text":"Download the most recent zip archive suffixed with -windows.zip available from pktd releases page For example: pktd-v1.4.0-windows.zip Unarchive the content of the zip file Open the command prompt and navigate to the bin directory in the extracted archive For Example: cd Downloads\\pktd*\\bin Follow the instructions below but In place of ./bin/pktwallet , use pktwallet.exe In place of ./bin/pktctl , use pktctl.exe","title":"Microsoft Windows"},{"location":"wallet_setup/pkt-cli-wallet/#macos-and-linux","text":"Download one of the most recent packages available for Linux or MacOS from pktd releases page For example, for pktd-v1.4.0 release: For MacOS , after having downloaded pktd-v1.4.0-macos.pkg , install pktwallet and other utilities by clicking on the package icon in the Finder.

However, if you leave it running, it will stay synced. This will save time when performing pktctl functions, such as folding and sending coins. If pktwallet has not been running for some time, it will need time to sync up to the current block from the time it last ran. As a safety precaution, don't forget to lock your wallet if you do keep it running.","title":"Should I leave pktwallet running?"},{"location":"wallet_setup/pkt-cli-wallet/#how-often-should-i-fold-and-why","text":"The purpose of folding is to turn all your small payments (such as from mining) into quickly and easily spendable coins. If you are multi-pool mining and have rewards in every block, you will have roughly 1440 unconsolidated transactions per day - one for each block at a rate of ~ 1 block/min. If you do not fold these transactions, after awhile you'll have a huge amount of transactions to process if you wish to send the sum or portion thereof of these smaller transactions. So, while folding isn't required and will have no impact on mining if you do or do not, you're doing yourself a favor later by keeping the transactions as consolidated as possible. It is typical to fold as much as possible every day or every few days when you think about it, depending on your use case. It can also be scripted. Note that folding is a transaction itself. Depending on how much you have to fold, you may need to run the command many times. You also may need to wait for coins to confirm before folding more. Once the folding command fails or you see a very low number in the outputcount field from running ./bin/pktctl --wallet getaddressbalances 1 1 or on PKT block explorer under Unconsolidated Txns, you have successfully folded the best you can for that point in time.","title":"How often should I fold and why?"},{"location":"wallet_setup/pkt-wallet-setup/","text":"How to setup a PKT Wallet \u00b6 PKT is its own unique blockchain and only interacts with specific wallets that support PKT.
